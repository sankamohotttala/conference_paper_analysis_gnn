Therefore, a variety of predictive analysis tools have been developed in this regard, with the objective of taking corrective action quickly and efficiently. In this paper, we present a TFW amount estimating method via plotting vibration generated during the cutting process on big data visualization and density cluster generation method known as Graphical Knowledge Unit (GKU). GKU generates density clusters by incrementing the RGB color values in the intersected markers due to data overlapping. In our previous work, the TFW amount of a cutting tool attached to a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) turning machine was checked. A workpiece of grey cast iron with an initial outer diameter of 110 mm was cut until it reached 60 mm. This process was repeated until the TFW amount, which was measured according to ISO 4288, met the recommended value range (0.3 ± 0.005 mm). After each cut, TFW amount and the surface roughness were measured following ISO 4288. Vibration was recorded using a triaxial accelerometer attached to the tool shank of the turning machine. In the present work, out of 29 cutting circles, vibration along the x-axis against vibration along the y-axis of selected cuttings were plotted using GKU. The density of the center of the plot (fixed point, FP) and the density of the highest density (dynamic point, DP) were measured using the color values of pixels as an index. The results showed a very strong linear correlation (0.95) between the TFW amount and vibration data density projected via pixel color values at FP. This shows that processing of vibration with GKU is a promising method to estimate TFW amount.","2613-8662","979-8-3503-4145-4","10.1109/SCSE59836.2023.10215035","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10215035","bigdata;industry 4.0;machine learning;predictive analysis;process optimization","Vibrations;Image color analysis;ISO Standards;Data visualization;Turning;Systems engineering and theory;Surface roughness","","","","14","IEEE","17 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, defaulting customers who fail to pay their dues after consuming services remain a significant challenge in the industry. Defaulters pose a risk to service providers, calling for measures to lessen both the probability of occurrence as well as its impact. Early identification of defaulters through prediction is a possible solution that enables proactive measures to mitigate the risk. However, the nature of the fixed-line product segment poses additional constraints in identifying defaulters, highlighting an existing knowledge gap. The research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning as a technique for the prediction of defaulters in the fixed-line telecommunication sector, and to develop an effective predictive model for the purpose. The success of machine learning techniques in analysis and prediction over traditional methods prompted its use in this study. The study followed the design science research methodology. An analysis was conducted based on past transaction data. Special consideration was given to the scenario of customers with little to no transaction history. Based on the analysis, a feature list for identifying defaulters was compiled, and multiple predictive models were developed and evaluated in comparison. The resulting predictive model, which uses the Random Forest technique, shows high performance in all considered aspects. The findings of the study demonstrate that machine learning techniques can effectively predict defaulters in the fixed-line telecommunication sector, with significant implications for mitigating the risk associated.","2613-8662","979-8-3503-4145-4","10.1109/SCSE59836.2023.10214995","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10214995","defaulter prediction;machine learning;fixed-line telecommunication","Industries;Design methodology;Machine learning;Predictive models;Telecommunications;Object recognition;History","","","","16","IEEE","17 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Code quality is crucial in determining the overall quality of software however, it is often observed that quality management programs primarily focus on internal processes within organizations, while the importance of code quality lacks proper attention despite the existence of quality standards for software products and processes. Due to its dynamic nature, the concept of quality poses a challenge in terms of precise definition, however, this paper addresses this issue by providing a comprehensive definition for code quality that considers all its dimensions, thus laying the foundation for conducting research related to quality. Code quality encompasses factors such as readability, scalability, performance, and adherence to industry standards. High-quality code is easy to understand, modify, and test, making it more reliable and less prone to bugs. By considering the multitude of challenges that currently exist and acknowledging the criticality of code quality, this study proposes an approach for assessing code quality, and a comprehensive quality model that considers the most critical code quality attributes and their relevant metrics along with corresponding threshold values specifically use in the contemporary software industry.","2613-8662","979-8-3503-4145-4","10.1109/SCSE59836.2023.10215004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10215004","code quality;quality metrics;quality attributes;quality models;software metrics","Measurement;Industries;Codes;Computational modeling;Standards organizations;Organizations;Software","","2","","18","IEEE","17 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, feature selection algorithms help to decrease the overfitting, reduce training time and improve the accuracy of the build models. Similarly, feature reduction techniques based on frequencies support eliminating unwanted features. Most of the existing work related to feature selection was based on general text and the behavior of feature selection was not evaluated properly with short text type dataset. Therefore this research was conducted to investigate how performance varied with selected features from feature selection algorithms with short text type datasets. Three publicly available datasets were selected for the experiment. Chi square, info gain and f measure were examined as those algorithms were identified as the best algorithms to select features for text classification. Moreover, we examined the impact of those algorithms when selecting different types of features such as 1gram and 2-gram. Finally, we look at the impact of frequency based feature reduction techniques with the selected dataset. Our results showed that info gain algorithm outperform other two algorithms. Moreover, selection of best 20% feature set with info gain algorithm provide the same performance level as with the entire feature set. Further we observed the higher number of dimensions was due to bigrams and the impact of n grams towards feature selection algorithms.

Recently, low-quality raisin products have been introduced to agricultural markets worldwide. Therefore, it is crucial to identify a suitable classification method to distinguish between varieties of raisins. Previous research has employed various traditional machine learning methods to classify commodities. However, it is challenging to quantify uncertainties through traditional machine learning models. Therefore, this study employed a Bayesian Logistic Regression (BLR) model using seven morphological features of two varieties of raisins grown in Turkey. Initially, different machine learning techniques were employed on data. After that, four priors, such as Jefferys, Laplace, Cauchy, and Gaussian, were considered, and hyperparameters were tuned using the empirical Bayes method. Marginal posterior distributions of the model parameters were estimated, and the convergence of the models was checked. Then, evaluation metrics of the BLR model with different priors were compared to those of machine learning models. According to the results, the BLR model with Gaussian prior produced the highest accuracy of 93%. Finally, it can be concluded that the BLR model with Gaussian prior provides substantially better results when classifying raisin data.","2613-8662","979-8-3503-4145-4","10.1109/SCSE59836.2023.10215003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10215003","Bayesian classification;Bayesian logistic regression;classification;machine learning;raisin","Measurement;Logistic regression;Uncertainty;Biological system modeling;Machine learning;Data models;Bayes methods","","","","46","IEEE","17 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

According to the New York Times, fake news is defined as “made-up articles meant to deceive.” Additionally, the way they are released is almost identical to that of conventional news organizations. The issue is that a significant number of news outlets outside the major and reliable ones are disseminating unreliable information. This problem is exacerbated by the ease with which anything can be published from anywhere on well-known social networking and social media platforms. People can use this to their advantage by disseminating any type of message on various social networking sites to accomplish their objectives. In the Sri Lankan context, content posted in Sinhala greatly impacts fake news in Sri Lanka. Because utilizing the Sinhala language to describe emotions and feelings makes it easier to connect with Sinhala-speaking people than using content that has been published in other languages, like English. The use of Sinhala on social media has grown over the past few years. Additionally, as the use of the Sinhala language expanded, so did the number of occurrences of fake news. Based on the literature, approaches to identifying fake news depend on the features of the news content. Therefore, this research proposed an autoencoder-based method for Sinhala fake news detection, which is an unsupervised method. The method uses Text, User, Propagation, and Image features from the news content. And also, this research found the best feature combination to detect Sinhala language fake news content, which is a combination of Text, User, and Image features. The method gained an accuracy of 98% and 88% in Precision, Recall, and F1 Score by outperforming other existing anomaly detection methods.

Early detection and timely treatment are crucial in treating eye diseases and preventing permanent vision loss. Detecting eye diseases early on is crucial in preventing or slowing down the progression of vision loss and blindness. Unfortunately, many eye diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and cataracts, do not have early warning signs or symptoms. Therefore, regular eye checkups and early detection of these diseases can be essential in preventing vision loss and improving the quality of life for those affected. Retinal fundus image screening is a commonly used technique for diagnosing eye disorders, but manual detection is time-consuming and labour-intensive. To address this issue, various researchers have turned to deep learning methods for the automated detection of retinal eye diseases. In this work, a convolutional neural network model has been developed for classifying eye diseases, demonstrating an impressive accuracy rate of 99.85%. This suggests that the model can correctly classify eye diseases in nearly 4 out of 5 cases.

This paper reveals a unique approach to driver emotion recognition for the calm, fear, sad, and anger emotional states where calm is the desired state of mind while driving. Emotiv EPOC X 14 channel EEG headset is utilised for the EEG collection, and ten subjects are involved in the experiment. EEG preprocessing of the collected EEG data is done using the EEGLAB toolbox in Matlab. EEG feature extraction is performed using Matlab, and feature selection and classification model training is done using the Classification Learner app in Matlab. ANOVA and ReliefF are employed as the feature selection algorithms, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naïve Bayes classifiers are utilised for the emotion classification. The outcomes reveal that the highest mean accuracy of 95% is achieved from the Coarse Gaussian SVM classifier, while the lowest mean accuracy of 85% is obtained from the Fine Gaussian SVM classifier detecting the calm, fear, sad, and anger emotional states. In addition, all the other trained classifier models have an accuracy between 85% and 95%. Therefore, the findings suggest that the proposed EEG-based implementation approach of an emotion classification model for drivers is highly successful and can be employed in future research in the paradigm of driver emotion recognition as well. Besides, this research presents a critical literature review concerning critical aspects of EEG-based emotion recognition research.","2613-8662","979-8-3503-4145-4","10.1109/SCSE59836.2023.10215028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10215028","EEG;emotion recognition;feature extraction;feature selection;road safety","Support vector machines;Training;Emotion recognition;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Mathematical models","","1","","48","IEEE","17 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a system to identify the suspicious tea leaves and BB disease at its early stages along with an assessment of severity, offering a potential solution to this critical issue. By utilizing real-time object detection, the system filters out non-tea leaves from the captured initial image of a segment of a tea plant. The identified tea leaves are then subjected to BB identification and severity assessment based on differing visual symptoms of the BB stages. This approach enables the system to accurately identify BB in the initial stage and severity stage, allowing for timely and targeted intervention to minimize crop losses.

Sri Lankan Sign Language (SSL) is the standard visual language used in Sri Lanka. Like other sign languages, the SSL relies on a distinct combination of hand gestures, body movements, and facial expressions for communication. As a result, SSL is more challenging for individuals without knowledge of SSL to understand. On the other hand, the steep learning curve associated with SSL makes it even more difficult to acquire. Thus, the interpretation of SSL has become a need. However, Sri Lanka is suffering from a severe dearth in the availability of SSL interpreters. This justifies the need to use either vision-based or sensor-based technological approaches to help the interpretation of SSL. However, vision-based approaches are susceptible to conditions such as skin tone, background color, ambient light intensity, and real-time constraints, whilst the sensor-based solutions are generally better in gesture recognition. Further, there is no attempt has been made on developing a cost-effective, portable, and real-time solution to accurately interpret the hand gestures of SSL. In this paper, we, therefore, present a novel, wearable, sensor-based, real-time gesture recognition glove, and a machine-learning Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to recognize the hand and finger positions in three-dimensional space for classification and interpretation of SSL. The proposed approach has achieved 320ms of lowest inference time while showing a promising result of 83% for categorical accuracy. Our aim is to help the interpretation of SSL with an affordable, portable as well as a real-time solution.","2613-8662","979-8-3503-4145-4","10.1109/SCSE59836.2023.10214999","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10214999","Gesture recognition glove;Sensor-based sign language interpretation;Sri Lankan Sign Language","Visualization;Solid modeling;Gesture recognition;Machine learning;Assistive technologies;Robot sensing systems;Real-time systems","","1","","30","IEEE","17 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The model is trained on a custom dataset from WhoSampled, an extensive database of information on sampled music, cover songs, and remixes. The dataset comprises pairs of audio samples and interpolations, making it suitable for the Siamese CNN approach. Incorporating Triplet Loss enhances the model’s performance by learning discriminative features for improved comparison.

Malaria is a blood disease brought on by Plasmodium parasites, which are transmitted by the bite of a female Anopheles mosquito. To diagnose the condition, medical experts analyse thick and thin blood smears. However, their precision is dependent on the quality of the smear and experience in categorising and counting parasitized and uninfected cells. Such an investigation could be complicated and time-consuming for large-scale diagnosis, resulting in poor quality as well. Deep learning (DL) approaches such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) offer highly scalable and improved performance with end-to-end feature extraction and classification in cutting-edge image analysis-based computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) procedures. Automated malaria screening employing DL approaches could contribute in the development of an effective diagnostic aid. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of VGG16, EfficientNetB3, InceptionV3, and ResNet50 as feature extractors to categorise parasitized and uninfected cells and aid in enhanced malaria disease screening.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated this problem, bringing it to the forefront of public discourse. This study aims to analyse the impact of HV by utilising Twitter data and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, categorising tweets into three groups: (i) HV Incident Tweets, (ii) HV Awareness Tweets, and (iii) HV Shelter Tweets. This categorisation provides several advantages, such as uncovering new or hidden evidence, filling information gaps, and identifying potential suspects. Over 40,000 tweets were collected using the Twitter API between April 2019 and July 2021. Data pre-processing and word embedding were performed to prepare the data for analysis. Initially, tweets were categorised into HV Positive (containing relevant information) and HV Negative (noise or unrelated content) groups. Manually labelled tweets were used for training and testing purposes. Machine learning models, including SVM, NB, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree (DT), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and LSTM, were employed for this task. Subsequently, HV Positive tweets were classified into the three aforementioned categories. Manually labelled tweets were again used for training and testing. Models such as Tf-IDF+SVM, Tf-IDF+DT, Tf-IDF+NB, and GloVe+LSTM were utilised. Several evaluation metrics were used to assess the performance of the models. The study’s results provide important new understandings of the prevalence, patterns, and causes of HV as they are reported on social media and how the general population reacts to these problems.

Planning for future demand and ensuring an adequate electricity supply poses a significant challenge. It is crucial to accurately forecast future demand in order to maintain an uninterrupted power supply. Previous studies have explored the correlation between weather factors and electricity demand with the aim of accurately predicting demand values. Thus, the objective of this study is to forecast the monthly electricity demand in Sri Lanka, by considering the influence of weather patterns. In this study, rainfall, humidity, and temperature weather parameters, along with historical monthly demand data, are taken into consideration. The identification of the most crucial weather variables is based on their correlation with electricity demand data. Various techniques have been employed for forecasting electricity demand over the past decade. However, the limitation of previous studies lies in their failure to incorporate past weather data alongside electricity demand data. This gap is addressed in the present study. This study used Vector Auto Regression (VAR) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to forecast monthly electricity demand in each district of Sri Lanka. The VAR model demonstrated lower values by comparing the performance metrics, including Root Mean Square Error, Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error. As a result, the VAR model was chosen as the most suitable model for forecasting monthly electricity demand by incorporating weather variables.","2613-8662","979-8-3503-4145-4","10.1109/SCSE59836.2023.10215047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10215047","electricity demand;weather patterns;forecasting","Reactive power;Temperature distribution;Correlation;Power supplies;Computational modeling;Weather forecasting;Predictive models","","","","38","IEEE","17 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The last-mile delivery in the e-commerce industry is facing high costs due to a going economic crisis which led to fuel and other operating cost increments. To overcome this situation, the e-commerce industry needs to optimise vehicle delivery routing based on time windows to minimise the overall cost. Despite numerous studies on last-mile delivery, there is a paucity of studies on last-mile delivery optimisation considering the customer’s anticipated time windows. Therefore, this study has been conducted with the objective of optimising and minimising transportation costs and vehicle usage in last-mile delivery operations while meeting some practical requirements such as a variety of package types, package compatibility on different types of vehicles; the customer expected delivery time windows and a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles. After a careful literature review, this paper introduces a mathematical model to optimise last-mile delivery. The proposed mathematical model was simulated in SupplyChainGuru® modelling and simulation software. The study concluded that the overall last-mile delivery cost is minimised by about 22% while reducing the number of vehicles on the route, failed delivery package count and utilising the maximum possible capacity of vehicles while also increasing customer satisfaction by giving consumers a chance to select customer preferred time windows for package delivery. This cluster-based delivery will improve the routing of the e-commerce logistic supply chain and will serve as a platform for extending the cluster-based delivery process to other industries as well.","2613-8662","979-8-3503-4145-4","10.1109/SCSE59836.2023.10215012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10215012","Vehicle routing problem with time windows;Ecommerce;Last-mile Delivery;Clustering","Industries;Costs;Roads;Vehicle routing;Routing;Mathematical models;Electronic commerce","","1","","27","IEEE","17 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

According to the past literature, there are a lot of road-based containerized cargo transportation issues in Sri Lanka. This study introduces a dry port-based containerized import/export cargo transportation method using a railway network to connect the port of Colombo and the Board of Investment (BOI) Export Processing Zones (EPZ). A dry port is an inland intermodal terminal, directly connected by a railway line to the Colombo port. The study mainly focuses on two dry port-based networks under several alternative network configurations. The locations of the proposed dry ports are Orugodawatta’s current customs clearing yard and cargo inspection center in Kerawalapitiya proposed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). In this study, mathematical models were developed to analyze and compare the advantages of the proposed network considering current freight demand under several scenarios from economic and environmental, and travel time perspectives. Then the study estimates the import/export BOI freight demand for 2050 and analyzes the potential of the proposed railway-based cargo transport system for 2050. These figures can be further reduced by optimizing the dry port location. Therefore, a simulation-based approach was considered to optimize the dry port location by Greenfield analysis method with “Supply Chain Guru” software. Through simulation results, the study shows the new dry-port location compatibility for the proposed system. The findings of the study have demonstrated a systematic approach to decision-making by optimizing the local cargo handling process.

To sustain this growth, e-commerce players must differentiate their offerings and operations to meet the evolving needs of customers, with customer satisfaction being a crucial factor in achieving a competitive advantage. Delivery logistics plays a critical role in ensuring customer satisfaction. A systematic literature review, following the PRISMA framework, identified the most impactful delivery logistics factors on customer satisfaction as delivery time, cost, and quality. Building upon this, the study utilized the mental accounting theory (MAT) to develop a conceptual framework. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between delivery logistics factors and customer satisfaction and to explore the moderating effect of geographical variations and product categories on this relationship. Data was collected from a sample of 272 respondents living in rural and urban areas, using a structured questionnaire. The data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The findings suggest that delivery logistics factors positively impact customer satisfaction and that the geographical location of customers, and the product category moderate this relationship. Specifically, for e-consumers from rural areas, delivery cost was found to be a significant predictor of customer satisfaction. Furthermore, delivery logistics factors positively influenced customer satisfaction for shopping and special goods, but not for convenience goods. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of delivery logistics in e-commerce, particularly in a developing country like Sri Lanka. It provides valuable insights for e-commerce players to enhance their operations and offerings, meet customers’ needs, and improve their competitiveness.","2613-8662","979-8-3503-4145-4","10.1109/SCSE59836.2023.10214985","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10214985","e-commerce;customer satisfaction;delivery logistics factors;geographical variations;product category","Costs;Systematics;Customer satisfaction;Urban areas;Buildings;Developing countries;Mathematical models","","","","54","IEEE","17 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
