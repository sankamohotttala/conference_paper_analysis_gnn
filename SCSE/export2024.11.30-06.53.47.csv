"Keynote Speech: An Industry 4.0 Approach to Plastic Repair","M. Isaksson","Swinburne University of Technology, Australia",2021 International Research Conference on Smart Computing and Systems Engineering (SCSE),"25 Oct 2021","2021","4","","xi","xi","Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Industry 4.0 refers to the fourth industrial revolution. While the third industrial revolution involved the introduction of robotics and IT, the fourth industrial revolution focuses heavily on interconnectivity, reconfigurable autonomous automation, machine learning, and real-time data. Industry 4.0 applies to the entire life cycle of a product, including repair and recycling. It addresses the challenges of designing automation solutions that can adapt to changing conditions and achieve highly customized production. These challenges are particularly common in repair applications, where automatic repair of different product variants with various defects requires an extremely flexible automation solution. A car headlight housing is priced between $300 and $6000. After a collision, the headlight housing often suffers only minor damages, such as one or a few broken plastic lugs; however, the entire headlight housing is typically replaced while the discarded unit ends up in landfill. Aside from the environmental impact, replacing a headlight housing has several other issues, including long lead times or cost and space issues if all headlight models would be stored. Manual repair is sometimes an option; however, it has multiple issues, including a lack of skilled workers and difficulties in achieving consistent quality and visually pleasing result. In this presentation Dr Isaksson will describe a recently concluded collaboration between Swinburne University, PlastFix, and Innovative Manufacturing CRC (IMCRC) targeting automation of plastic repair. The presentation will showcase how advanced robotics, 3D printing, 3D scanning, and the development of a novel polypropylene composite filament were integrated to create a demonstrator for automatic repair of car headlight housings.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-0965-0","10.1109/SCSE53661.2021.9568352","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9568352","","Maintenance engineering;Fourth Industrial Revolution;Plastics;Automobiles;Three-dimensional printing;Three-dimensional displays;Service robots","","","","","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Innovative, person-centred strategies are required to monitor and predict physical activity and exercise behaviours, to scan and anticipate environmental barriers to activity, and to provide social and motivation support. Integrated Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and assistive technologies promise play a key role in this regard by enabling people to live their life well regardless of their chronic conditions. HAR is the classification of human movement, captured using one or more sensors either as wearables or embedded in the environment (e.g., depth cameras, pressure mats). In our work, we introduce learning-to-learn personalised models from few data. We extend the meta-instance creation process where random sampling of support and query sets is carried out on a reduced sample conditioned by a domain-specific attribute; namely the person or user, in order to create meta-instances for personalised HAR. I will present our recent work on learning personalised HAR models with few data and motivate our contribution through an application where personalisation plays an important role, mainly that of human activity recognition for self-management of chronic diseases.

The present practices of diagnosis of ASD are highly subjective and time-consuming. Today, as a popular solution, understanding abnormalities in brain functions using brain imagery such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), is being performed using machine learning. This study presents a transfer learning-based approach using Inception v3 for ASD classification with fMRI data. The approach transforms the raw 4D fMRI dataset to 2D epi, stat map, and glass brain images. The classification results show higher accuracy values with pre-trained weights. Thus, the pre-trained ImageNet models with transfer learning provides a viable solution for diagnosing ASD from fMRI images.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-0965-0","10.1109/SCSE53661.2021.9568314","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9568314","epi images;fMRI;Inceptionv3;stat map images;transfer learning","Decision support systems;Autism;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Transfer learning;Transforms;Glass","","6","","33","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Smart technologies in tourism: a study using systematic review and grounded theory","A. C. M. Nafrees; F. H. A.

Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have had a profound impact on the tourism industry, and they continue to be the key drivers of tourism innovation. ICTs have fundamentally changed the way tourism products are developed, presented, and offered, according to the literature. Any empirical studies or experiments must be focused on accepted or formed hypotheses. In this regard, grounded theory measures were used for interpretation, while a systematic review was performed to assess the research scope from current studies and works. The main goal of the study is to investigate and propose long-lasting and stable smart technologies for implementing smart tourism. Grounded theory is a concept that uses methodical rules to gather and dissect data in order to construct an unbiased theory. Fewer studies on smart technology in tourism have been conducted, with a majority of them concentrating on IoT, virtual and augmented reality, big data, cloud computing, and mobile applications. In either case, there is space for further investigation into this important field of study. As a result, this paper is a vital first step toward a clearer understanding of how smart technology can be applied to the tourism industry. The number of available research work on smart technologies in tourism were fewer from the selected journals and conference proceedings, which led to the accessibility of lesser data for analysis.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-0965-0","10.1109/SCSE53661.2021.9568338","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9568338","IoT;smart technology;smart tourism;systematic review;tourism","Technological innovation;Cloud computing;Systematics;Current measurement;Tourism industry;Systems engineering and theory;Mobile applications","","4","","45","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Temporal preferential attachment: Predicting new links in temporal social networks","P. Wickramarachchi; L. Munasinghe","Faculty of Science, Software Engineering Teaching Unit, University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka; Faculty of Science, Software Engineering Teaching Unit, University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka",2021 International Research Conference on Smart Computing and Systems Engineering (SCSE),"25 Oct 2021","2021","4","","22","27","Social networks have shown an exponential growth in the recent past. It has estimated that nearly 4 billion people are currently using social networks. The growth of social networks can be explained using different models. Preferential Attachment (P A) is a widely used model, which is often used to link prediction in social networks. P A tells that the social network users prefer to get linked with popular users in the network. However, the popularity of a node depends not only on the node's degree but also on the node's activeness which is reflected by the amount of active links the node has at present. Activeness of a link can be quantified using the timestamp of the link. The present work introduces a novel method called Temporal Preferential Attachment (TPA) which is defined on the activeness and strength of a node. Strength of a node is the sum of weights of links attached to the node. Here, the weights of the links are assigned according to their activeness. Thus, TP A captures the temporal behaviors of nodes, which is a vital factor for new link formation. The novel method uses min - max scaling to scale the time differences between current time and the timestamps of the links. Here, the min value is the earliest timestamp of the links in the given network and max value is the latest timestamp of the links. The scaled time difference of a link is considered as the temporal weight of the link, which reflects its activeness. TP A was evaluated in terms of its link prediction performance using well-known social network data sets. The results show that TP A performs well in link prediction compared to P A, and show a significant improvement in prediction accuracy.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-0965-0","10.1109/SCSE53661.2021.9568278","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9568278","activeness of links;link prediction;social networks;TP A","Social networking (online);Predictive models;Systems engineering and theory","","1","","17","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Automatic road traffic signs detection and recognition using ‘You Only Look Once’ version 4 (YOLOv4)","W. H. D. Fernando; S.

The traffic sign detection and recognition system (TSDR) play an essential role in the intelligent transportation system (ITS). TSDR can be utilized for driver assistance and, eventually, driverless cars to reduce accidents. When driving an automobile, the driver's attention is usually drawn to the road. On the other hand, most traffic signs are situated on the side of the road, which may have contributed to the collision. TSDR allows drivers to view traffic sign information without having to divert their attention. Due to the existence of a large background, clutter, fluctuating degrees of illumination, varying sizes of traffic signs, and changing weather conditions, TSDR is an important but difficult process in intelligent transport systems. Many efforts have been made to find answers to the major issues that they face. The objective of this study addresses road traffic sign detection and recognition using a technique that initially detects the bounding box of a traffic sign. Then the detected traffic sign will be recognized for usage in a speeded-up process. Since safe driving necessitates real-time traffic sign detection, the YOLOv4 network was employed in this research. YOLOv4 was evaluated on our dataset, which consisted of manual annotations to identify 43 distinctive traffic signs classes. It was able to achieve an average recognition accuracy of 84.7%. Overall, the work adds by presenting a basic yet effective model for real-time detection and recognition of traffic signs.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-0965-0","10.1109/SCSE53661.2021.9568285","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9568285","Intelligent Transport systems;Traffic sign Detection;YOLOv4","Roads;Face recognition;Computational modeling;Lighting;Manuals;Real-time systems;Autonomous automobiles","","8","","15","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When real-life problems are considered, the above technology processes are essential in solving the issues. Food is an essential need of human beings. Food supply has become crucial, and it is very important to increase the adequate cultivation of plants for large populations due to huge population growth. At the same time, farmers are struggling with a variety of food plant diseases that significantly affect the harvesting and production in agricultural fields. Nevertheless, the agricultural productivity of rural areas is directly involved with the increase in the economic growth of developing countries such as Sri Lanka, India, Myanmar and Indonesia. Early identification of crop disease, using a well-established modern technique, is vital. It necessitates a number of processes observing large-scale agricultural fields as a disease can infect different parts of the plant such as leaf, roots, stem and fruit. Most diseases appear in plant leaves and have the potential to spread them all over the field within a very short time. This paper reviews several state-of-the-art methods that can be used for plant leaf disease recognition with a special reference to deep learning based methods.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-0965-0","10.1109/SCSE53661.2021.9568324","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9568324","attention mechanism;Deep Learning;disease identification;image processing;Machine Learning","Deep learning;Machine learning algorithms;Plants (biology);Sociology;Crops;Classification algorithms;Information and communication technology","","4","","26","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study explores the possibility of thought identification using a commercially available EEG device using deep learning techniques. The crucial part of any EEG experiment is contamination-free data collection. Keeping the subject's mind concentrated only in the decided state is important, yet challenging. To address this issue, we have developed a graphical user interface (GUI) based program that allows stimulus controlling and data recording. With the use of the low-cost commercially available EEG device, accuracies up to 89% were achieved for the classification of high contrast signals. However, tests on complex thought identification did not produce statistically significant results over the chance accuracy.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-0965-0","10.1109/SCSE53661.2021.9568320","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9568320","brain-computer-interface;classification;EEG;signal processing","Deep learning;Visualization;Time series analysis;Pattern classification;Data collection;Tagging;Electroencephalography","","","","16","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A proper mechanism should be followed to generate these potential leads and target audiences. The majority of people who were born between 1981 and 2012 hold top positions in companies. These people are regular social media and website users, since they represent generations Y and Z. They usually keep digital footprints. Therefore, if an accurate method is followed, it is possible to identify potential contact points by analysing publicly available data. In this research, a novel lead generation mechanism based on analysing social media and web data has been proposed and named L YZGen (Leads of $Y$ and $Z$ Generations). The input to the L YZGen model was an optimised search query based on the user requirement. The model used web crawling, named entity recognition (NER), and pattern identification. The model found and analysed freely available data from social media and other websites. Initially, person name identification was performed. An extensive search was carried out to retrieve peoples' contact points such as email addresses, contact numbers, designations, based on the identified names. Cross verification of the analysed details was conducted as the next step. The results generator provided the final output, which contained the leads and details. Generated details were verified with responses captured via a survey and identified that the model could detect lead details with 87.3 % average accuracy. The model used only the open data posted on the internet by the people. Therefore, it did not violate extensive privacy or security concerns.

The study proposes a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture which is considered to be one of the most trending and efficient forms of classification of DR stages. Initially, the preprocessing techniques were employed to the DR fundus images with Green channel extraction and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). The data augmentation strategy was utilised to increase training images from the DR images. Finally, Feature extraction and classification were carried out by using the proposed CNN architecture. It consists of a 14 layered CNN model, which continues three main classifications. In this proposed classification, the images were classified into a tree structure based binary classification as No_DR and DR at the beginning, and then the DR images were again classified into two classes, namely Pre_Intermediate and Post_Intermediate. Moreover, those two classes were again separately classified into Mild, Moderate, and Proliferate_DR, Severe, respectively.

Community-level trust is an important aspect in the organic agriculture industry. Organic farming, in most parts of the world, happens in small scale farms where the farmers represent rural and less-privileged communities. Even though third-party certification systems exist for quality assurance in organic farming, due to many socio-economic reasons, participatory guarantee systems (PGS) have become a popular alternative among organic farmers and consumers. However, such participatory guarantee systems are still prone to frauds and have limitations in scalability as well. With the recent rise of blockchain technology, there is an emerging trend to adopt blockchain technology to enhance the credibility of organic food supply chains and mitigate the risk of fraudulent transactions. However, despite the popularity of participatory guarantee systems among organic farmer communities, the blockchain researchers have paid little attention to develop blockchain architectures by adopting the community-level trust into their consensus protocols. The hybrid consensus mechanism presented in this paper addresses that gap in existing blockchain research. Apart from discussing the details of the proposed blockchain architecture and the underlying consensus protocol, this paper also presents a qualitative analysis on the proposed architecture based on expert opinions.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-0965-0","10.1109/SCSE53661.2021.9568325","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9568325","blockchain;community-level trust;Federated Byzantine Agreement;hybrid consensus mechanisms;proof of authority","Quality assurance;Scalability;Supply chains;Computer architecture;Systems engineering and theory;Market research;Agriculture","","5","","33","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, nutrition applications are mushrooming in the fitness domain to aid people to improve their dietary intake, track weight-related elements, and generate meal plans. Considering the applications that are typically built for meal planning, it was apparent that personalized nutrition incorporated with healthy meal suggestions is not well addressed, and hence the need for a personalized meal recommendation system that assists the users to achieve their fitness goals is identified. Learning users' food preferences and delivering food recommendations that plead to their taste and satisfy nutritional guidelines are challenging. Due to the lack of access to a proper meal planning application or without professional help most users follow ineffective, generic meal plans which hinder them from achieving their fitness goals and often cause long-term and short-term health complications.

Especially, for business organizations such as technology companies, the human resource is the driving factor of the company's growth which depends on employees' motivation, skills and quality of work. Employees often change their jobs when they are not satisfied with it. Different factors may cause a change in the level of job satisfaction of an employee. For example, the dynamic nature of the Information Technology (IT) industry is an impactful factor that determines the job satisfaction of IT professionals. Foreseeing the employees' job satisfaction makes it easy for a company to take swift actions to improve the job satisfaction of its employees. In this research, we analyzed the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) methods for predicting job satisfaction using employee job profiles. There are job-specific factors in each job domain, and those factors may influence job satisfaction levels. Therefore, this research focused on the following fundamental questions: 1) How do existing ML models perform when predicting job satisfaction of software developers? 2) Can the job satisfaction prediction models be generalized to the other job roles in the IT industry? This study compared the performance of classification models: Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network (NN) in predicting the level of job satisfaction. Our experiments used two benchmark datasets: Stack Overflow developer survey and IBM HR analytics dataset. The experimental analysis shows that both employee-related factors and company-related factors contribute similarly to predicting job satisfaction.

Automobile price prediction studies have been a most interesting research area in machine learning nowadays. The independent variables to model the price and the price predictions are equally important for automobile consumers and manufacturers. Automobile consulting companies determine how prices vary in relation to the independent variables and they can then adjust the automobile's design, commercial strategy, and other factors to fulfill specified price targets. Furthermore, the model will assist management in comprehending a company's pricing patterns. The ability of machine learning systems to predict outcomes is entirely dependent on the effective selection of features. In this paper, we determine the influencing features on automobile price using an integrated approach of LASSO and stepwise selection regression algorithms. We use multiple linear regression to build the model using the selected features. From the experimental results using the automobile dataset from the UCI machine learning repository, the influencing features on automobile price are width, engine size, city mpg, stroke, make, aspiration, number of doors, body style, and drive wheels. Training data accuracy for predicting price was found to be 92 %, and testing data accuracy was found to be 87%.

As of July 2021, within nineteen months since this infectious disease started, more than one hundred and eighty million cases have been reported. The incubation period of the virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can be defined as the period between exposure to the virus and symptom onset. Most of the affected cases are asymptomatic during this period, but they can transmit the virus to others. The incubation period is an important factor in deciding quarantine or isolation periods. According to current studies, the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 ranges from2 to 14 days. Since there is a range, it is difficult to identify a specific incubation period for suspected cases. Therefore, all suspected cases should undergo an isolation period of 14 days, and it may lead to unnecessarily allocation of resources. The main objective of this research is to develop a classification model to classify the incubation period using machine learning techniques after identifying the factors affecting the incubation period. Patient records within the age group 5–80 years were used in this study. The dataset consists of 500 patient records from various countries such as China, Japan, South Korea and the USA. This study identified that the patients' age, immunocompetent state, gender, direct/indirect contact with the affected patients and the residing location affect the incubation period. Several supervised learning classification algorithms were compared in this study to find the best performing algorithm to classify the incubation classes. The weighted average of each incubation class was used to evaluate the overall model performance. The random forest algorithm outperformed other algorithms achieving 0.78 precision, 0.84 recall, and 0.80 F1-score in classifying the incubation classes.

The emergence of Cloud Computing has evolved towards microservice concepts, which are highly demanded by corporates for enterprise application level. Most enterprise applications have moved away from traditional unified models of software programs like monolithic architecture and traditional SOA architecture to microservice architecture to ensure better scalability, lesser investment in hardware, and high performance. The monolithic architecture is designed in a manner that all the components and the modules are packed together and deployed on a single binary. However, in the microservice architecture, components are developed as small services so that horizontally and vertically scaling is made easier in comparison to monolith or SOA architecture. SOA and monolithic architecture are at a disadvantage compared to Microservice architecture, as they require colossal hardware specifications to scale the software. In general terms, the system performance of these architectures can be measured considering different aspects such as system capacity, throughput, and latency. This research focuses on how scalability and performance software quality attributes behave when converting the SOA system to microservice architecture. Experimental results have shown that microservice architecture can bring more scalability with a minimum cost generation.

The quality and safety of food has become a crucial factor in the food industry. Most of the customers tend to pay more attention to food safety and seek to get food from verifiable resources. To improve this trustworthiness Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) - based Food Supply Chain (FSC) plays a vital role because of its traceability. There are multiple actors involved throughout the journey of FSC and with the high visibility of data in DLT, everyone can ensure trust. The transparency of data itself is a reason for some to opt-out because some of their private data can be exposed to others. Hyperledger Fabric (HF) based FSC can address that matter as it supports permissioned network solutions. Though there are a lot of solutions available in a similar kind of approach, whether the crops take their journey throughout the FSC without any wastage, is still questionable. This study focuses on reducing wastage of food crops as they take a long journey in their raw state and possible hazards are high. It discusses farmers' behavior based on the Sri Lankan context and how it accompanies food crop wastage. Further, this paper ruminates the other possible crop wastage that can take place in FSC and how to eliminate it with the proper involvement of knowledgeable and authorized parties.

The organization focus is on maximizing shareholder wealth, while employees try to obtain the maximum benefits for themselves. As per the motivational theories, people have different types of needs. Therefore, management should focus on a wide range of factors to motivate the employees to work to their full potential in the interest of the organization. The study focuses on both employee and the management of a state bank. The organization is always eager to minimize the cost and maximize the profit. Game Theory was used to provide a mathematical framework for understanding the optimal outcome and what the tradeoffs are to achieve that outcome. The objective is to find the right balance between financial gains and employee satisfaction. To fulfill that objective, one needs to evaluate the benefits given to employees, the effectiveness of those benefits on employees and finally recommend an effective benefits allocation mix to the organization, which will address both employee and the top management of the bank.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-0965-0","10.1109/SCSE53661.2021.9568302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9568302","employee satisfaction;Game Theory;optimization","Costs;Organizations;Systems engineering and theory;Resource management;Game theory","","","","10","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sri Lanka is also facing these climate changes over the past few decades. It has resulted in rainfall pattern changes where the expected rain may not occur during the expected time and amount. The mismatch between the rainfall pattern and traditional seasonal cultivation schedule has critically affected the agricultural sustainability. Even with the current technological advancements, weather prediction is one of the most technically and scientifically challenging tasks. This paper presents a novel machine learning-based approach for predicting rainfall for precision agriculture in Sri Lanka and it can be recognized as the first attempt to validate machine learning models to predict the weather in Sri Lankan context for precision agriculture. By analyzing the nature of the weather in Sri Lanka, the relationship of weather attributes with agriculture, availability, and accessibility, seven attributes are selected including rain gauge, relative humidity, average temperature, wind speed, wind direction where solar radiation and ozone concentration are uniquely selected for Sri Lankan context. For the prediction model, cross-validated data are trained and tested with four machine learning algorithms: Multiple Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. Currently, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors models have achieved accuracies of 88.57%, 88.66%. Random Forest has been recognized as the best-fitted model with 89.16% accuracy. The results depict a significant accuracy in this novel approach for Sri Lankan weather prediction.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-0965-0","10.1109/SCSE53661.2021.9568319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9568319","data mining;machine learning;precision agriculture;weather prediction","Support vector machines;Rain;Wind speed;Weather forecasting;Predictive models;Agriculture;Solar radiation;Climate change","","7","","23","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this reason, 3D technology is driving major innovations in the food industry. This paper presents the construction of a chocolate 3D printer by applying the pressure pump technique using chocolate as a printing material. Here the conventional 3D printer's design was developed as a chocolate 3D printer. As an improvement, a new extruder mechanism was introduced. The extruder was developed to print the chocolate materials. In the working mechanism, the 3D printer reads the design instruction and chocolate material is extruding accordingly, through the nozzle of the pump to the bed of the 3D printer followed by the design (layer by layer). The special part of this chocolate 3D printer is the pressure pump in the extruder part. That pressure pump provides pressure on melted chocolate from the chocolate container to the nozzle point. The usability and efficiency of the 3D printer were tested with sample designs. The obtained results were presented and discussed. Together with these advances this 3D printer can be used to produce complex food models and design unique patterns in chocolate-based sweets by satisfying customers.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-0965-0","10.1109/SCSE53661.2021.9568345","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9568345","3D printing;additive manufacturing;food printing;hot melt extruder;pressure pump","Industries;Geometry;Technological innovation;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Cooling;Production","","3","","7","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The MSA is very much effective considering the true benefits of scalability, flexibility, cost-effectiveness, etc. However, there are significant challenges in the use of MSA as well in the viewpoint of the seniors in the field of Software Engineering (SE). So, the objective of this research is to introduce a theoretical framework to be followed by the SE industries to address the challenges they face in providing MSA-based software solutions. In this research, the literature of MSA is evaluated in detail to understand the influencing factors to cater to the requirements of the software developments. In methodology, two research questions are derived based on the hypothesis of not getting adequate benefit in the process of adopting MSA for software application development; 1. What are the challenges to implementing applications incorporating MSA? 2. How to achieve the exact needs of the clients via MSA? For this study, based on purposive sampling the five SE professionals are selected for interviews to understand the true impact on identified factors through literature for development challenges and client satisfaction. Further, thematic analysis is conducted for evaluating those extracts of the interview qualitatively. Nevertheless, the online questionnaire is distributed among a wide range of SE professionals in the domain of MSA implementation for overall understanding about significant factors filtered out through the literature and the interviews, and those were analyzed descriptively. Based on the findings, a theoretical framework is introduced for successful implementation of MSA assuring the clients' requirements. Eventually, this study confirms how MSA adaptation with the theoretical framework is effective for both organizations and clients.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-0965-0","10.1109/SCSE53661.2021.9568346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9568346","development;framework;microservices;modularize","Industries;Costs;Scalability;Computer architecture;Organizations;Systems engineering and theory;Interviews","","2","","17","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Proper application of software development methodologies assists software designers to run IT projects to the success of achieving the satisfaction of project stakeholders. Because of the issues raised by traditional software development methodologies such as the Waterfall model, the IT industry began to employ Agile methodology for IT project management. However, due to the separation of software development and operation teams, Agile methodology also caused problems. DevOps is a new approach adapted to the Agile methodology that collaborates the software development and operation teams in order to provide continuous development of high-quality software in a short period of time. However, there are practical issues reported since DevOps approach is still in its infancy in the IT industry. The purpose of this research is to analyze the use of the DevOps concept in IT Projects by evaluating the challenges and mitigating strategies practiced by software development firms in order to ensure the success of IT projects. This purpose was achieved by performing a literature study and soliciting recommendations from industry professionals using a questionnaire survey. The findings reveal the critical challenges and prioritization of challenges experienced by software firms while adopting DevOps, as well as their practices for overcoming those challenges.

A realistic case study was done to obtain the arc current under parallel and series arcs. As seen from the results, a parallel arc creates a current much higher than the load current, whereas a series arc current is often lower than the load current. Even though a parallel arc current may be detected by an overcurrent device, as it is often intermittent, it may not sustain to be captured by existing protection devices.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many organizations had undergone supply chain disruptions due to the forward and backward propagation of disruptions in the global supply chain networks, implying the importance of building up resilience in the supply chain networks. This study intends to systematically review the existing literature to determine the impact of optimal decision-making during crises to build up supply chain resilience. The paper has focused on the need for evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the FMCG industry and how supply chain resilience would improve in performance during such crises. The study also assessed the existing decision support systems for resilience in a supply chain network and their applicability during a crisis. Some of these models could be used to facilitate decision-making during an epidemic as well. Precisely determining resilience factors affected during an unexpected circumstance would enhance the value of the decision support system in use. Furthermore, it was concluded that the use of quantitative models should be further investigated, as most published work focuses on the conceptualization of a restricted number of resilience factors instead of the development of integrated, comprehensive approaches.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-0965-0","10.1109/SCSE53661.2021.9568303","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9568303","decision-making;fast-moving consumer goods;resilient supply chains","Decision support systems;COVID-19;Industries;Systematics;Pandemics;Computational modeling;Supply chains","","8","","38","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the advancement in technology, the demand for smooth and hassle-free transportation increased and it is particularly true for road transportation in Sri Lanka as well. As a result, the expressway road network was introduced to Sri Lanka in 2011. Although a toll is payable for the use of expressways, many vehicle users prefer to utilize the expressway due to the extensive amount of time saved. Time is of utmost importance for expressway users. Hence, long queues and waiting time at toll plazas where the toll payment is made should be minimized. This study is aimed at analyzing the performance at the Peliyagoda toll plaza of the Colombo-Katunayake expressway where the formation of long queues and long waiting time in queues can be observed during peak hours. Due to the high complexity of using the analytical approach in obtaining the performance measures, a simulation approach was used with Arena Simulation Software. Few setup improvements were identified, and each of the setups were simulated to obtain the performance measures.

The main objectives of this paper are to determine the key success factors associated with the Sri Lankan 3PL industry and identify the interrelationships of these key success factors. A systematic literature review and expert opinions were used to identify the key success factors of the 3PL industry in Sri Lanka. In total 21 key success factors were obtained, and those key success factors were grouped into four categories as organization strategy, management, and process, human resources, and customer orientation. Q-sort technique was used to group key success factors into four categories. Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method was used to capture the interactive relationships among the key success factors of 3PL service providers, and the casual effect map analyzed. Data were collected through questionnaires from middle and senior-level managers of 3PL firms. A total of eleven experts in the 3PL industry participated in the data collection process. The result shows that organization strategy is a core success factor since it has both high prominence and high interrelationship. Management and process were classified as driving factors since they had a low prominence but a high interrelationship. However, human resources and customer orientation had high prominence but low relationship, which are influenced by other factors and cannot be directly improved.
