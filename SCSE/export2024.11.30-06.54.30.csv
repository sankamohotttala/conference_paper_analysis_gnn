Gemstone market prices rely on the implicit knowledge of professional gem evaluators. Complexity in gemstone valuation due to their inherent variability leads to subjective decisions. This creates a necessity for establishing a standardized model that mitigates the risk of overpricing or underpricing of gemstones. Developing a standardized model for gemstone valuation benefits stakeholders and upholds the esteemed reputation of the gem industry. This research developed high-tech models to assess faceted blue sapphires, taking the exported gemstone records from the National Gem and Jewellery Authority. The dataset comprehends a total of 881 records with both single (409) and batch (472) assessments of faceted blue sapphire gemstones. This study identified the pivotal factors for gem valuation, such as colour, inclusions, cracks, cut, weight, state of treatment, and calibration. Multiple machine learning regression models, including multiple linear regression (MLR), quantile regression (QR), support vector regression (SVR), feedforward neural network (FFNN), and generalized regression neural network (GRNN), were employed in building pricing models. The MLR and QR models resulted in inadequate pricing models due to the violation of model assumptions. While SVR, FFNN, and GRNN exhibited similar performances, GRNN outperformed in evaluating both single and batch assessments. For pricing single assessments, the SVR model with the Gaussian kernel exhibited a superior performance. The proposed efficient and reliable pricing models to assess faceted blue sapphires will directly benefit appraisers and indirectly gem collectors and investors. This study also recommends exploring future research paths, including the integration of decision support tools like computer-trained pricing models, to assess other varieties of gemstones and enhance their broad applicability.","2613-8662","979-8-3503-7568-8","10.1109/SCSE61872.2024.10550868","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10550868","Blue Sapphire;Feedforward Neural Networks;Gemstone Valuation;Generalized Regression Neural Networks;Support Vector Regression","Industries;Support vector machines;Computational modeling;Linear regression;Pricing;Machine learning;Vectors","","","","12","IEEE","11 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to not taking the danger into account before the trip, we might have to experience numerous problems and risks. As a result, there may be dangerous situations for the driver and passengers and time and fuel wastage. Thus, the issue is how to evaluate the road while choosing the route before using it and What elements are crucial to take into account while evaluating a route’s issues. This project aims to develop a system to evaluate risk before a vehicle enters a dangerous area and predict the best path by evaluating aspects of roads including accidents, road repairs, and road blockers. Image Classification is used to detect road repairs and blockers. Federated Learning will be used to improve the accuracy of the Road blocker detector. Here, Clients will train locally using private data, send their optimized parameters to the central server, and then aggregate those trained parameters to produce a global model. This process will be continued until the system has a trained model that is ideal for predicting roadblocks. YOLOV7 object detector will be used to detect vehicle collisions and accidents in real-time. Finally, Federated Learning will be used to notify users about detected incidents and event details will be marked in a Google map which is running on a Flask application. Using the Blocker map, drivers can decide which route is more suitable based on the proposed system’s detections and blocker details.","2613-8662","979-8-3503-7568-8","10.1109/SCSE61872.2024.10550467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10550467","federated learning;image classification;image processing;supervised learning;yolo","Federated learning;Roads;Detectors;Maintenance engineering;Data models;Real-time systems;Servers","","","","21","IEEE","11 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, for effective HAR, it is necessary to identify transitions accurately. In this paper, we present a novel HAR method which focuses on recognizing both basic activities and transitional activities using accelerometer and gyroscope data. We have implemented a stacked-ensemble model for activity classification using both traditional machine learning algorithms and neural networks.

A quality dataset is an important ingredient for all kinds of natural language processing tasks. To analyse the performance of the machine reading comprehension task for the Tamil language an MRC dataset based on Tamil short stories was created as part of this research. A question count-based analysis was performed to verify the variety of questions. This analysis found that the Tamil Short Story for MRC task dataset possesses a similar ratio of question types compared to SQuAD 1.1.

Social media platforms like Facebook have provided individuals with an outlet to express their thoughts and emotions, creating an opportunity for mental health professionals and researchers to gain valuable insights into their mental wellbeing. As a result, sentiment analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting sentiments from textual data, offering a promising avenue for predicting suicidal tendencies through social media posts. While previous studies have explored sentiment analysis for this purpose in various other languages, a critical gap exists in research literature focusing on the Sinhala language, spoken by a substantial population in Sri Lanka and other regions in the world. Understanding the sentiments and emotional states of individuals expressed themselves in Sinhala on social media can have significant implications for suicide prevention effort. Machine learning algorithms and techniques can be leveraged to analyze and predict the likelihood of suicidal tendencies based on sentiments expressed in posts. In this paper, we therefore present a social media intelligence approach to predict suicidal ideation from Sinhala Facebook posts. The proposed predictive model provides invaluable insights to mental health professionals, facilitating the development of targeted interventions and support systems for individuals at risk. The proposed hybrid sentiment analysis methodology consists of a machine learning model and a sentiment lexicon trained on carefully selected labelled social media text data. Each text is then classified as either suicidal or not, using Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression algorithms. When compared their results, we could achieve the best results with the Naïve Bayes algorithm resulting in an accuracy of 79% proving that social media intelligence can be used to predict suicidal ideation from Sinhala Facebook Posts.","2613-8662","979-8-3503-7568-8","10.1109/SCSE61872.2024.10550899","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10550899","Suicidal ideation;Social media;Sentiment Analysis;Machine Learning","Support vector machines;Sentiment analysis;Machine learning algorithms;Social networking (online);Sociology;Mental health;Prediction algorithms","","","","27","IEEE","11 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this study presents a comprehensive simulation study on assessing the performance of Feedforward neural networks (FFNN) with the random data split procedure. For this purpose, eight nonlinear models from the literature were employed to generate multiple series where they represent different features available in the time series data. The complexity of the selected models was further improved by introducing Poisson processes with different jump sizes. From each selected time series model, 30 replications were generated using distinct initial random seeds for the error term. The data were randomly partitioned, allocating 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing purposes. The FFNN models were fitted incorporating the inputs from past observations and moving average values. Moreover, each individual fitted model was trained 30 times to obtain a statistically robust evaluation of model performance through the averaging of predictive values. The findings reveal that the FFNN models performed well with the random data split procedures for time series data with lower minimum error values. The same idea was observed by graphs fitted between the actual test values and the average of the forecasted values.

Larger student populations increase the time needed for individual assessment, leading to potential delays and subjectivity introduces biases, resulting in inconsistent evaluations. Moreover, as student numbers rise, the imbalance in teacher-to-student ratios affects grading quality, impacting fairness and effectiveness in educational assessments. Automated grading systems have emerged as a solution to address these issues. These grading systems mainly prioritize appearance, emphasizing grammar and format. However, they struggle to accurately assess content quality, often missing contextual relevance. This problem can potentially be resolved by employing highly trained domain-specific models. However, a drawback arises as these models are limited to evaluating answers only within predefined domains. While these specialized models excel in assessing responses within their designated fields, their utility is restricted when evaluating answers outside of these predefined domains. This limitation poses a challenge in achieving broader applicability for assessing answers outside the specific areas the models were trained for. This study proposes a rubric-based method paired with Large Language Models (LLMs) to introduce objectivity, ensuring fairness and reliability in evaluations while achieving generalizability. Rubric provides a clear and customizable marking schema for assessing short answers across various domains. By using predetermined marking criteria and conditions, the grading process becomes more objective and transparent. The proposed method efficiently evaluates short answers in various domains using Large Language Models (LLMs), based on these established criteria, reducing subjective biases. This research aims to revolutionize education by creating a robust automated short answer scoring system that comprehensively evaluates contents across domains and addresses teacher-to-student ratio issues.","2613-8662","979-8-3503-7568-8","10.1109/SCSE61872.2024.10550624","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10550624","Automated short answer grading;Rubric-based;Large Language Models","Computational modeling;Sociology;Education;Manuals;Grammar;Delays;Time factors","","","","19","IEEE","11 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The analysis of activation maps of each CAM method and EnsembleCAM confirmed that in activation maps of EnsembleCAM, higher activation values were more concentrated around the nucleus which is the most important region in indicating cervical malignancy. The evaluation using pixel flipping performance metric also proved that the EnsembleCAM effectively recognises regions vital to the model's decision-making through its steepest drop in the mean prediction score when the pixels in the region contributing most to the model's decision were flipped.","2613-8662","979-8-3503-7568-8","10.1109/SCSE61872.2024.10550859","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10550859","class activation maps;ensemble explanations;explainable artificial intelligence;medical image classification;transparent classification visualization","Visualization;Decision making;Closed box;Predictive models;Cams;Reliability;Medical diagnosis","","1","","24","IEEE","11 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this issue, clustering, an unsupervised learning technique, can be used as a powerful tool. Mainly, there are two types of clustering algorithms namely, model-based and distance-based algorithms. Previous literature suggested that model-based clustering algorithms outperform distance-based algorithms using only visualization techniques and descriptive statistics. This study employed an inference-based procedure to test this claim. In this research, an extensive simulation study that compares the performance of model-based and distance-based algorithms was conducted using univariate Gaussian mixtures with varied parameters, generating non-homogeneous samples. Both algorithms were applied to non-homogeneous samples and performances are compared using the estimated cluster memberships and true cluster memberships. The effect of modality in the population on the clustering was also considered. Cluster Identification Ability (CIA) and clustering accuracy were used as performance measures. Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) was used to measure the clustering accuracy. Results indicate that the CIA and clustering accuracy of the model-based method increases as the sample size increases within the range of sample sizes considered when the modality condition is satisfied. When the modality condition is not satisfied, CIA and clustering accuracy initially drop and then show a slight rise as the sample size grows within the specified range. For the distance-based method, CIA and clustering accuracy decrease as the sample size increases when the modality condition is not satisfied but increase most of the time when the modality condition is satisfied. Further, the results suggested that the claim ""model-based clustering algorithms outperform distance-based algorithms"" is not always true. To check the agreement between simulation study results and real-world data, ""Old Faithful"" waiting times were used.

With billions of hours of video content uploaded and viewed daily, effective content organisation and discovery are critical. BART is a transformer-based model with unique properties that are ideal for summarising textual data. This study investigates BART’s ability to summarise textual content by incorporating video Closed Captions (CC) and using the popular natural language processing library Hugging Face to generate relevant and engaging titles for YouTube videos. The methodology consists of several steps designed to maximise the potential of BART summarisation. Initially, a diverse dataset of YouTube CC was gathered, representing a wide range of genres and content types. This dataset served as the foundation for training the BART Large CNN model. Hugging Face’s transformers library was then used to fine-tune the pre-trained BART model on a specific CC dataset, making it more adaptable to different YouTube content. The fine-tuning process involved adjusting the model’s parameters to match the properties of YouTube CC. It ensured that the model accurately captured the essence of the spoken content while remaining contextual. The trained and fine-tuned BART model effectively captures the essence of the video in concise and engaging headlines. For example, ""my channel is back"" is the generated title for the video with the title ""I Was Hacked. But Now I’m BACK!"" and ""amazing facts about water soft vs. hard"" is the generated title for the video with the title ""Hard vs. Soft Water: What’s The Difference?"".

Many analyses of road traffic accident data employ data mining techniques, with a focus on identifying factors influencing accident severity. Nonetheless, any damage resulting from road accidents is consistently deemed unacceptable due to its implications on health, property, and various economic factors. Occasionally, it is observed that road accidents occur more frequently and pose higher risks at specific locations. Analyzing these locations can aid in identifying key features contributing to the frequent occurrence and increased risk of accidents.One popular data mining technique for identifying correlations in various attributes of road traffic accidents is association rule mining. In this paper, The association rules were generated through the application of the Frequent Pattern (FP) Growth Algorithm. To facilitate this analysis, the k-Means algorithm was utilized to categorize locations into three groups: High-Risk Hotspots (HRH), Moderate-Risk Zones (MRZ), and Low-Risk Areas (LRA) based on their Accident Frequency Count and Accident Average Severity Score. This approach focused on locations with diverse risk levels, facilitating an analysis of frequent incidents, rather than concentrating solely on areas with a high frequency of accidents. The generated rules unveiled different factors associated with road accidents at locations exhibiting varying Accident Frequency Count and Accident Average Severity Score. Our approach uncovered some valuable hidden insights from the data which can be utilized to make some preventive efforts in these locations.","2613-8662","979-8-3503-7568-8","10.1109/SCSE61872.2024.10550547","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10550547","Association rule mining;Data mining;k-Means clustering;Road safety analysis;Road traffic accidents","Economics;Road accidents;Clustering algorithms;Systems engineering and theory;Road traffic;Road safety;Safety","","","","18","IEEE","11 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in the case of Peru and Paraguay, there was no sensitivity to all three factors, other than the CPIA quality of public administration, within the institutional factors, which showed a slight positive sensitivity in Paraguay. Notably, the comparative analysis reveals that Ukraine exhibits the highest level of exchange rate volatility compared to all other three countries. These findings serve to bridge the empirical and conceptual gaps in the existing literature on exchange rate volatility and may help policymakers to develop sustainable frameworks for exchange rate stability, which is very critical in economic development. The originality of this research lies in its focus on a comparative analysis of exchange rate volatility determinants in four distinct emerging economies: Sri Lanka, Peru, Paraguay, and Ukraine. These countries represent different regions and economic characteristics, offering a diverse range of factors that can influence exchange rate volatility. By comparing these economies, the study provides a unique perspective on the drivers of exchange rate volatility across various contexts.","2613-8662","979-8-3503-7568-8","10.1109/SCSE61872.2024.10550903","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10550903","currency fluctuations;floating rate;inflation;international trade","Exchange rates;Sensitivity;Economic indicators;Databases;Stability criteria;Social factors;Macroeconomics","","","","19","IEEE","11 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study employs the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework in conjunction with the evaluation of academic pressure to measure student engagement. The research aims to understand the impact of cognitive presence, social presence, and teaching presence on learning outcomes in e-learning, while also examining how infrastructure plays a moderating role. The data were gathered through a structured questionnaire, and the gathered data were analyzed using SmartPLS 4 software. The findings highlight that cognitive presence, social presence, and teaching presence significantly predict better learning outcomes, emphasizing their crucial role in the effectiveness of e-learning in programming language courses. The study doesn't find a strong connection between the academic pressure felt by undergraduates and the learning outcomes. This suggests that success in e-learning is influenced by various factors beyond traditional academic pressures. Additionally, we investigate the moderating effect of infrastructure on these relationships. Unexpectedly, the study reveals that infrastructure doesn't significantly change the connections between cognitive presence, social presence, and teaching presence on learning outcomes. In simpler terms, the technical support provided doesn't seem to alter how these elements impact student success in this context. This study offers valuable insights into the intricate dynamics of student engagement, academic pressure, and infrastructure within the realm of e-learning.

Lecturers upload recorded lectures on these platforms, aiding students having connectivity issues and supporting distance education. However, these lecture recordings are often too lengthy to efficiently navigate to the most attentional content, which includes essential information provided in the lecture. This study proposes a new method to navigate lengthy videos by automatically identifying the most attentional content in video lectures. It would be a better alternative to the existing findings, such as text search in the audio transcript or manual video pausing. Three sub-questions drove the research: what are lecturers’ most common techniques to emphasise the most attentional content, how can these techniques be identified in slides, and how can a navigational structure be created to access the most attentional content in video lectures? The research employed a constructive research approach. It started with a questionnaire to uncover lecturers’ common techniques, such as text highlighting, underlining, and writing on the slides to denote the most attentional content. The study included a comparative analysis of existing image processing techniques such as Contour Detection, Canny Edge Detection, and Probabilistic Hough Line Transformation, and a machine learning object detection model named EfficientDet DO 512x512 to identify the most attentional content in video frames. The findings revealed that the object detection model was more effective in identifying the most attentional content. Finally, the research employed a strategy involving video frame capturing, slide transition detection, tagging video frames with timestamps, and relevant transcribed words to generate the navigation structure. The findings demonstrated that the navigation structure could effectively locate slides containing the most attentional content with high precision values. Hence, this research can probably aid in the deeper analysis of video frames and enhance student learning from video lectures in online courses.","2613-8662","979-8-3503-7568-8","10.1109/SCSE61872.2024.10550668","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10550668","attentional content;navigation index;slide analysis;video frames;video lectures","Navigation;Education;Object detection;Manuals;Writing;Tagging;Probabilistic logic","","","","13","IEEE","11 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, the obstacle of migration, particularly brain drain, is a substantial barrier to the expansion of the local software engineering sector. This study utilizes the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a conceptual framework to investigate the cognitive processes that affect migratory tendencies in the software engineering sector in Sri Lanka. This study utilizes SmartPLS software and the PLS-SEM technique to examine and evaluate the relationships between crucial elements that influence the intention to migrate within the software engineering industry in Sri Lanka. Twenty-seven influential elements were initially identified through a thorough literature review and expert opinions. These factors were then categorized into five primary groupings that are in line with the TPB, along with a set of moderator factors. The data analysis was conducted in two distinct stages, where direct relationships and moderator relationships were examined independently. Political and economic concerns, as well as job satisfaction, were used as moderators. Results indicate that all variables significantly impact the intention to migrate at a 0.05 significance level. Nevertheless, subjective norms had a distinct impact on migration intentions only among individuals aged 30-35. Unexpectedly, perceived behavioral control exhibited a negative relationship with migration intentions, which contradicts the Theory of Planned Behavior framework. Furthermore, both job satisfaction and perceived behavioral variables exclusively moderated attitudes. Ultimately, this research provides insight into the complex connection between several factors that affect migration patterns in the software engineering industry in Sri Lanka. It also offers practical implications for industry stakeholders and policymakers.","2613-8662","979-8-3503-7568-8","10.1109/SCSE61872.2024.10550751","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10550751","Brain Drain;PLS-SEM;Software Engineering;Sri Lanka;Theory of Planned Behavior","Industries;Fluctuations;Government;Finance;Systems engineering and theory;Software;Stakeholders","","","","29","IEEE","11 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This national task focused on applying a more appropriate pedagogical approach to make a relatively complex subject like AI easier for students to understand. When the literature is examined, it is seen that different teaching approaches were used to teach AI worldwide, and authentic learning has been considered the most appropriate method. This study was conducted to assess the applicability of the learning module, which has been developed based on authentic learning techniques to teach AI to grade six school children in Sri Lanka. A qualitative study was conducted among six ICT school teachers who engage in teaching for lower secondary grades. Participants were selected purposefully to gather more important views on the research question. Key informants’ interviews were conducted using a qualitative guide, and all interviews were audio recorded following informed consent. All recordings were reviewed, and important areas were identified. Results revealed that our module provides more opportunities for the students to learn AI with their real-life experiences, moves students from passive receivers of information to active participants in their own discovery process, increases their motivation and retention to learn AI and helps to improve 21stcentury skills, i.e., learning skills, literacy skills and life skills, of the learners. The analysis of the results provided strong evidence to conclude that the developed learning module will be useful in teaching AI to grade six school children in Sri Lanka using an authentic learning approach. Similarly, it will enhance the knowledge and skills of students related to AI in a more sustainable manner to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century and the 4th industrial revolution.","2613-8662","979-8-3503-7568-8","10.1109/SCSE61872.2024.10550813","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10550813","21st century skills;artificial intelligence;authentic learning;curriculum design;pedagogical approach","Education;Receivers;Learning (artificial intelligence);Recording;Fourth Industrial Revolution;Artificial intelligence;Interviews","","","","17","IEEE","11 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a countermeasure to this problem, coupled with the recent movement toward decarbonization, there is a movement to promote the introduction of renewable energy, including photovoltaic power generation, whose prices have fallen in recent years. The purpose of this study is to quantitatively understand the causal relationship of the impact of photovoltaic and thermal power generation on electricity prices by conducting a causal inference analysis using propensity scores. As a result, increasing photovoltaic power generation was confirmed to have the effect of lowering area prices in two power service areas. On the other hand, it was confirmed that thermal power generation has the effect of increasing area prices in two power service areas.","2613-8662","979-8-3503-7568-8","10.1109/SCSE61872.2024.10550863","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10550863","area price;photovoltaic power generation;thermal power generation;propensity score","Photovoltaic systems;Renewable energy sources;Electricity;Thermal engineering;Low-carbon economy;Thermal conductivity;Systems engineering and theory","","","","6","IEEE","11 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Functional Size Measurement of IoT Devices using COSMIC Function Point: A Novel Set of Guidelines","P. Rajapaksha; T. K.

The paradigm for the IoT is dynamic and continuously evolving. In this paper, we present a COSMIC Function Point (CFP) based approach to address the problem of measuring the functional size of IoT devices for postmortem analysis. We propose a set of mapping guidelines and recommendations, outlining the best practices for using COSMIC Functional Size Measurement (FSM) in quantifying the size of IoT devices developed with ESP8266 System-on-Chip (SoC) using Arduino platform. Guidelines have been established to measure the functional size of an IoT device precisely, which is essential for its maintenance activities such as error corrections, capability enhancements, removal of obsolete features, and performance optimization. Exploring the ESP8266 SoC and Arduino platform, the paper investigates the relationship between the functional size and other system-related technical indicators like Random Access Memory (RAM) usage and code size through use of case studies involving real-world sample IoT prototypes. As a result, we derive RAM usage and code size of IoT devices from their CFP count, leading to invaluable insights. The knowledge acquired from our study therefore contributes to developing a more accurate and efficient method for estimating the functional size of IoT devices. The study also offers relevant information about the application of COSMIC FSM based on software source code, benefiting both academia and industry. Further, we believe this research is an essential step toward increasing the effectiveness of using FSM for the postmortem analysis of IoT devices.","2613-8662","979-8-3503-7568-8","10.1109/SCSE61872.2024.10550485","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10550485","CFP;COSMIC;ESP8266;FSM;IoT","Codes;Source coding;Random access memory;Prototypes;Size measurement;Systems engineering and theory;Software","","","","27","IEEE","11 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
