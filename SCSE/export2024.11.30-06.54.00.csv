"Design of an Online Platform for the Agriculture Community to Localise Scientific Knowledge and Foster Sustainability","S. Pathirage; A. Ginige","School of Computer Data and Mathematical Sciences, Western Sydney University, Australia; School of Computer Data and Mathematical Sciences, Western Sydney University, Australia",2022 International Research Conference on Smart Computing and Systems Engineering (SCSE),"4 Oct 2022","2022","5","","1","8","Sustainable agricultural practices are critical to emerging global hunger and environmental issues. Knowledge is the key to improving such practices. In agriculture, knowledge is categorised as local and scientific, where both have their potential. Within the agriculture community with respect to knowledge, there are creators and consumers. Scientists and extension officers who disseminate scientific information can be seen as knowledge creators and farmers as knowledge consumers. This separation leads to a mismatch between the creators' and consumers' contexts, leading to scientific knowledge not applying to the local context. Further, such knowledge disregards practical local knowledge. The challenge is to bring both contexts together and enable knowledge co-creation in a scalable manner to generate context-specific crop recommendations. We designed an online community platform to combine knowledge creation and consumption to enable knowledge co-creation. This will help to generate context-specific crop recommendations while overcoming the tyranny of space and time. First, we identified characteristics of a conducive knowledge creation space through a literature review and designed an enabling space for the agriculture community to develop farming practices. Then we identified user stories for community members. Next, we designed a prototype where scientists, extension officers, and farmers could develop practice packages (PoP). The community knowledge creation process can be initiated with published farming practices. Then, based on the context, the agriculture community can build dialogue to find unavailable information, verify available information based on practicality and finalise the PoP. This intervention will bring knowledge creation contexts closer to where knowledge is put into action and facilitate the agriculture community to harness the power of both local and scientific knowledge to perform farming practices better.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-7375-0","10.1109/SCSE56529.2022.9905109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9905109","farming practices development;knowledge creation;knowledge co-creation;online community platform;virtual space","Economics;Prototypes;Crops;Production;Agriculture;Mobile applications;Task analysis","","","","35","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sentimental analysis or opinion mining uses data mining and natural language processing techniques to discover, retrieve and filter the information and opinions from the World Wide Webâ€™s vast textual information. The sentiment analysers for European languages and some Indic languages are fully developed. However, Tamil, which is an under-resourced language with rich morphology, has not experienced these advancements. A few experiments have been conducted to determine the sentiments for Tamil text. An approach to doing the sentiment analysis for the Tamil language is proposed in this paper. The proposed approach uses Long Short-Term Memory, Convolutional Neural networks, and simple Deep Neural Network techniques. Test results show that the Long Short-Term Memory-based deep learning model performs well than the Convolutional Neural Network and simple Deep Neural Network for sentiment analysis of Tamil language with 94.10% accuracy.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-7375-0","10.1109/SCSE56529.2022.9905170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9905170","BLSTM;deep learning;sentiment analysis;Tamil","Deep learning;Sentiment analysis;Perturbation methods;Neural networks;Training data;Morphology;Europe","","","","26","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, speech recognition or Automatic speech recognition often refers to converting human speech or voice to textual information with the help of artificial intelligence algorithms. With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence technologies and extensive research being conducted in AI, speech recognition has received much attention and has emerged as a subset of Natural Language Processing where the advancement and accuracy in speech recognition will open many ways to provide a high standard of human-computer interaction. In this study, using the pre-trained transformer model with a transfer learning approach, the English to Python dataset was used to train the transformer model to produce syntactically correct source code in python. Additionally, the Word2Vec model was used to generate voice-to-text as input for the model. For the purpose of demonstration, a custom Python IDE is developed to generate source code from voice input. The results and findings suggest that in the transformer model, with the use of transfer learning, any dataset can be trained to produce syntactically correct source code. The modelâ€™s training loss and validation loss were below 5 and 2.1, respectively. Future research can focus on generating valid source code from any human spoken language without restricting it to English only.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-7375-0","10.1109/SCSE56529.2022.9905095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9905095","deep learning;natural language processing;source code generation;voice to source code;voice-based IDE","Training;Source coding;Computational modeling;Transfer learning;Neural networks;Programming;Transformers","","2","","54","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This mental disorder is hard to predict and its symptoms are complex. The main objective of this research is to develop a model to predict postpartum depression risk levels using mother's family, social background, and other data-related status of the mother. Also, using Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) has classified risk levels into 4 classes mild, moderate, severe, and profound, and trained and evaluated the proposed system on a Sri Lankan mothersâ€™ dataset based on their postnatal period within 6 months of childbirth. To build the proposed system this study has used Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFANN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System with Genetic Algorithm (ANFIS - GA), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Because after reviewing past literature can find many models have gotten the best performance through these models. Finally, depending on the model's performance has supposed to identify which model has good performance when predicting. After model training and testing, the FFANN model (95% accuracy) and the ANFIS - GA model (testing error: 0.0600) have good performance as classification and regression types of models, respectively. Then comparing both models' performance, concluded that FFANN with multi-classification has the best performance when predicting postpartum depression risk levels.

While new technologies have been adapted over the years, there is still a need for effective plant disease recognition systems because of the existence of harmful plant diseases that can spread rapidly. Effective and early recognition of plant diseases is vital to minimize the damage to crops and hence can save the farmers from potential loss. It is also important for many countries to maintain economic stability, especially for the countries that completely rely on agriculture. In the past, many traditional and deep learning-based approaches have been proposed for plant disease recognition. While traditional approaches need insightful domain expertise, deep learning-based approaches require large sets of labeled data. Further, most of the existing methods fail to meet benchmark performances in terms of recognition accuracy. Therefore, in this study, a novel deep hybrid architecture is proposed to perform plant disease recognition from plant leave images. The Google Inception and ResNet architectures are utilized as the core networks to construct the proposed network. The proposed framework is evaluated on a newly constructed dataset with large sample size. The comparative analysis reveals that the proposed approach can outperform other state-of-the-art deep networks.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-7375-0","10.1109/SCSE56529.2022.9905092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9905092","artificial neural network;deep learning;hybrid network;plant disease recognition","Economics;Image recognition;Plants (biology);Computer architecture;Systems engineering and theory;Agriculture;Stability analysis","","","","24","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Social media platforms became more popular when they started supporting native languages. The problems with social media also evolved as popularity grows. Social media platforms were banned for Sri Lankan users in 2019 to prevent the spreading of hate messages and incorrect information among citizens. The lack of automatically recognizing tools for hate messages in Sinhala and Romanized Sinhala was reported as the reason for the ban. Itâ€™s also a waste of time and money to manually identify them. Many studies have been conducted to identify hate messages in both English and Sinhala separately. Users in Sri Lanka tend to combine Sinhala, Romanized Sinhala, and English phrases while expressing their opinions."" Mama job ekakata apply kara,"" for example. To train, an open-source data set which consists of 2500 comments, was used. And the comments were categorized as either hateful or non-hateful. To pre-process the data set, an Open-source stop word corpus and stem word corpus in Sinhala were utilized, and two corpus were manually converted into Romanized Sinhala stop word corpus and Romanized Sinhala stem word corpus to identify stop words and stem words in Romanized Sinhala. All English words were recognized using an open- source English word corpus, and a library was utilized to obtain stop word corpus and stem English words. As a result, doing research to identify hate speech in all of the languages indicated above will be more effective in reaching Sri Lankan users. The bag of words and term frequency-inverse document frequency were compared for feature engineering. Linear Support vector classifier, Random Forest Classification, SGD classifier, Logistic Regression, XGBoost classifier and multinomial Naive Bayes classifier are used as classification algorithms and evaluated.

The surge in patients has made it challenging for hospitals and medical professionals to keep up due to the increasing number of recorded incidents. When the pandemic starts, it is getting really hard to visit a medical specialist, even in more remote areas. According to the Johns Hopkins universityâ€™s Covid dashboard, approximately 220 million Covid cases were reported worldwide [2]. According to government hospital reports, 666,086 cases were found in Sri Lanka [3]. Itâ€™s a massive amount to handle for the health sector and the country. Consequently, there are many deaths reported every day as a result of the challenges in inpatient care. Because all patients are treated in their homes, this must be done efficiently. Only the most urgent cases are being treated in hospitals. Hospitals and quarantine centers are overcrowded. People in remote areas are also trying to treat the disease without knowing anything about it because they have limited access to information. This is because it needs a Chatbot to help with diagnosing Covid symptoms at home, and to assist patients in finding the right treatment options. An artificial intelligence (AI) Chatbot has been developed with the goal of diagnosing COVID-19 exposure and advising rapid remedies. As part of this analysis, relevant past research was reviewed to establish the best reliable approach for predicting COVID-19 in people. There was an integration of Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to develop the model. The model was trained with the clinical data taken from the COVID-19 patients and machine learning models are evaluated to see how accurate they are. It was determined how accurate the algorithms were. The patients who were infected with COVID-19 were examined by using implemented prototype to predict the severity level and the trained model makes use of RASA Framework, FastAPI, and MongoDB for the purpose of making predictions. The accuracy of the trained model and random sample tests seems similar. So, the prototypeâ€™s efficacy is perfectly matched. In rural areas, it can help patients by providing them with proper advice on how to treat, what preventive measures are, and what nearby health services are. It can also help patients by reducing the psychological damage that may be caused by their isolation from other people.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-7375-0","10.1109/SCSE56529.2022.9905107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9905107","chatbot;COVID-19;health assistant;RASA Open-Source;NLP","COVID-19;Machine learning algorithms;Hospitals;Prototypes;Chatbots;Prediction algorithms;Data models","","2","","14","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The notion of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is widely considered in monitoring drivers to safeguard their lives on roads. As a solution to the issue of the higher rate of road accidents, driver emotion recognition approaches have gained much attention, and the involvement of biological signals in detecting the emotional states of drivers is also significant. The authors have conducted a comprehensive literature review that concerns contemporary literature on the driver emotion recognition paradigm and comes up with four emotional states in this research to monitor the drivers' affective states. This paper presents a novel approach to detecting sad, angry, fearful, and calm emotional states of drivers with an emotion classification model using Electroencephalography (EEG) signals where the EEG data acquisition for the research is done using the Emotiv EPOC X device.

Apart from vaccination, one of the best precautionary measures is wearing masks in public. Face Mask detection models that are deployable on single board computers (SBC) enable data security, low latency, and low cost in the real-world deployment of face mask detection systems. Offline deployment is possible on SBC as data is referenced on the device compared to a server implementation while securing monitored individualsâ€™ privacy. Thus, this paper aims to implement an autonomous vision system that is deployed on Raspberry Pi devices to detect face masks in real-time. Performances of MobileNet, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures were compared in both standard hardware and edge devices. We used the TensorflowLite format to compress the model for deployment. Accuracy, precision, and recall were used as metrics to compare the model performance. MobileNet achieved the overall best test accuracy of 97.93% while MobilNetV2 attained 96.12% ranking second. Each modelâ€™s average inference times for standard hardware and a raspberry pi 4 device were measured by connecting to a camera feed.

With this, fraudulent activities have also increased considerably. Although many supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques were proposed in past research for identifying fraudulent transactions, they do not fully utilize the tabular and hierarchical structure present in transaction datasets. Recently, the TabBERT neural network model was proposed to calculate row-wise embeddings that capture both inter and intra dependencies between transactions in tabular time series data. In this research, we present a systematic experimental framework to assess the effectiveness of applying the embeddings calculated using the TabBERT model for credit card fraud detection. We employ the calculated row embeddings for fraud detection using three unsupervised machine learning algorithms and two supervised machine learning algorithms. We perform our experiments on a synthetic dataset that has been generated using the TabGPT model. Overall, TabBERT-based embeddings increase the performance of the supervised learning models with the extreme gradient boosting model achieving a precision of 99% and an F1 score of 98%, and the multilayer neural network model achieving a precision of 97% and an F1 score of 95%.

Revealing a micro-expression is quite difficult for humans because people tend to conceal their subtle emotions. As a result, training a human is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, it is important to develop robust computer vision and machine learning methods to detect micro-emotions.

People nowadays read their interesting news on news websites. There are numerous categories of news. Each newsreader has a different preference for news categories. Sportspeople prioritize sports news, whereas technology fans pay attention to the technology segment of the news. At the end of the day, each news category is important. Every day, a large amount of information is released on news websites. News sites usually categorize the news however, not all of the categories are published on those sites. Some categories are given higher attention by news outlets, while others receive less coverage. As a result, finding an appropriate category of news is tough. These issues make it difficult for newsreaders and content seekers to find relevant sections on news websites. The clustering of English news articles by relative category provides solutions to these issues. This research aims to use clustering algorithms to cluster news articles depending on the relevant domain/cluster. We consider five news categories: politics, sports, health, technology, and business. The data collected online was converted into a vector format using the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization. Then, on the body of the news and the news heading, the three clustering algorithms: Expectation-Maximization (EM), Simple K-means, and Hierarchical Clustering based on an agglomerative approach were applied individually. The Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) toolâ€™s classes to clusters evaluation model are used to calculate the accuracy. The EM method had the maximum accuracy of 88.5% with the best results in terms of correctly clustered instances.

A blockchain is a digital ledger consisting of transaction records that is duplicated and distributed to every participant computer in the network. Insurance industry is one of the most significant sectors where large institutes dominate the market. The traditional insurance process is highly centralized and cost-intensive to both insurance companies and customers. The process involves a third party to handle several processes among multiple parties manually in the form of paperwork. Inefficiency in centralized, manual processes lead to large frictional costs being borne by the customers. Also, conflicts of interest between insurance companies and policyholders are very common due lack of trust, lack of transparency, and ambiguity in policy terms. To provide a solution for these issues in the traditional centralized systems, this research proposes a blockchain-based, decentralized platform for insurance. The platform aims to replace the conventional insurance companies.

The creation of Internet of Things operating systems (OS), which can handle the newly constructed IoT hardware, as well as new protocols and procedures for all communication levels, all of which are now in development, will pave the way for the future. When compared to other devices, these gadgets require a comparatively little amount of electricity, memory, and other resources. This has caused the scientific community to become more aware of the relevance of IoT device operating systems as a result of their findings. These devices may be made more versatile and powerful by including an operating system that contains real-time capabilities, kernel, networking, and other features, among other things. IEEE 802.15.4 networks are linked together using IPv6, which has a wide address space and so enables more devices to connect to the internet using the 6LoWPAN protocol.

There are large projects going on in many industries that collaborate between robots and other robots, as well as humans and robots. In hospital environments, care for people with medical needs and their needs and used to make appropriate suggestions to their problems. Robots can also be found in certain areas that can respond quickly as an emergency rescue agent. Furthermore, robots, which can be seen in the hotel industry as waiters and as farm assistants in agriculture, have a great tendency to be used as multi-tasking agents in many fields. In each of these areas, robots must co-operate with humans. In that situation, the importance of the exchange of mutual knowledge between robots-robots and between humans-robots comes into the picture. What matters here is not only the quantitative vastness of knowledge but also the ability to understand each other in the same medium. Although the common sense that people need in their day-to-day work is completely obvious to humans, the commonsense knowledge domain needs to be implanted in robots. Whatever concept is defined for adding commonsense to robotics, it should be a consistent concept that can be logically constructed so that it can be understood by a machine. As will be discussed later in the paper, different methods have been used in various related works to add a different kind of domain knowledge to robotics. The objective of this paper is to provide an improved retrained model for robotics in order to give them the ability to act more human-like when performing tasks. By using the proposed model robots are able to answer the incomplete command or inquiries related to a given context.

Due to the increased use of email communications, day-to-day computer users; particularly corporate users, find it cumbersome to filter the most important and urgent emails out of the large number of emails they receive on a given business day. Enterprise email systems are able to automatically identify spam emails but still, there are many non-urgent and unimportant emails among such non-spam emails which cannot be filtered by conventional spam filter programs. Though it may be feasible to set up some static rules and categorize some of the e-mails, the practicality and sustainability of such rules are questionable due to the magnitude of such rules, and the validity period as such rules may become redundant after some time. Thus, it is desired to have an email filtering system for non-spam emails to filter unimportant emails, based on the userâ€™s past behaviour. Despite the availability of research on identifying spam e-mails in the area of further classifying the non-spam e-mails, is lacking. The purpose of this research is to provide a machine learning-based solution to classify non-spam e-mails considering the importance of such e-mails. As part of the research, several machine learning models have been developed and trained using non-spam e-mails, based on the personal mailbox of the first author of this research.

Every year, a large number of aerosols are released from dust storms into the atmosphere, manipulating a deleterious impact both on the environment and human lives. Even if an increasing emphasis is being placed on dust storms due to the rapid change in global climate in the last fifty years by utilizing the measurements from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), the possibility of utilizing MODIS true-color composite images for the task has not been sufficiently discussed yet. Here, a supervised ensemble learning approach comprising three state-of-the-art models is proposed to detect dust aerosols in the atmosphere of the Earth to test the above hypothesis. The proposed method incorporates a linear combination of U-Net, DeepLabv3+ and Swin U-Net as the deep learning architecture which quantifies a binary semantic segmentation problem of distinguishing dust-susceptible and non- susceptible regions in each unconstrained MODIS image. The framework is tested upon a custom-developed dataset from MODIS measurements which contains 1020 true-colour images, over land and ocean. The ground truth label for each image is manipulated through handcrafted binary segmentation which results in a binary ground truth image for each true-colour MODIS image. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) and average pixel accuracy (ACC) in terms of the semantic detection of dust aerosols. In the final testing, the framework achieved its highest Acc of 87.3% with a mIoU of 75.2%. The obtained performance of the framework surpasses the single state-of-the-art modalities and thus, aggregates to a more accurate implementation in the domain of dust aerosol detection.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-7375-0","10.1109/SCSE56529.2022.9905145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9905145","deep learning;dust storm;ensemble model;MODIS data","Satellites;Storms;Atmospheric measurements;Computational modeling;Atmospheric modeling;Terrestrial atmosphere;Sea measurements","","2","","26","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is a morphologically rich language, which is a derivation of Pali and Sanskrit. The Sinhala language creates a diglossia situation, as the languageâ€™s written form differs from its spoken form. With this difference, the written form requires more complex rules to be followed when in use. Manually proofreading the content of Sinhala material takes up much time and labor, and it can be a tedious task. Hence, a system is necessary which can be used by different industries such as journalism and even students. At present, there are a handful of systems and research that have automated Sinhala spelling analysis and grammar analysis. In addition, the existing systems are mainly focused on either spelling analysis or grammar analysis. However, the proposed system will cover both aspects and improve upon existing work by either optimizing or re-building the process to provide accurate outputs. The proposed system consists of a suffix list built for verbs and subjects, which helps the system stand out from the current proposed solutions. This research intends to implement a service for spell checking and grammar correctness of formal context in Sinhala. The research follows a rule-based approach with some components adopting a hybrid approach. As per the literature survey, many papers were analyzed, related to different aspects of the proposed system and complete systems. The proposed system would be able to overcome most barriers faced by previous papers whilst it takes a fresh take on providing a solution.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-7375-0","10.1109/SCSE56529.2022.9905126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9905126","automated Sinhala spelling analysis;grammar analysis;part of speech tagging;subject characteristics analysis","Industries;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Journalism;Grammar;Task analysis","","","","14","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the development of ITS, road sign detection and identification are considered to be very important due to the vital information provided by road signs. Generally, real-time video-based methods are used as the source of images for the operation of ITS. But they are inefficient and costly due to certain limitations like weather conditions, lighting conditions, and limited range in obtaining quality images. To overcome the limitations of the video-based approach, this research aims to develop techniques for detecting and identifying road signs by using Google Street View (GSV) as the image source, OpenCV for image processing and CNN for road sign identification. EdleNet, LeNet-5, and DenseNet were identified as accurate CNN models. Using images from GSV, generating a database of road signs with the relevant coordinates was possible, which is currently unavailable in Sri Lanka. In addition, this process leads to the generation of a valuable image dataset of Sri Lankan road sign images, and a web interface with mapped road signs. Consequently, this research would yield useful findings that may be applied to future research and provide the means to develop ITS, accident-avoidance systems, and driver assistance systems.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-7375-0","10.1109/SCSE56529.2022.9905148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9905148","Google Directions API;Google Street View (GSV);intelligent transportation systems;Machine Learning;road sign detection and identification","Road accidents;Databases;Roads;Image processing;Lighting;Real-time systems;Internet","","","","21","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

All the working arrangements are now based at home than before. Since this has been novel to society, the impact caused by this crisis on people is unknown in the short or long term. Since various factors can cause mental distress among online workers, periodic screening for mental distresses such as anxiety, depression, and stress is necessary for health and well-being. The causes of mental distress are multifactorial. They include socio-demographic, biological, economic, environmental, occupational, and psychological aspects. This paper proposes a concept of a screening system to predict mental distress given the external features associated with individuals, using supervised machine learning approaches and identifying the employees prone to higher risk and referring them early to professional assistance. The study was conducted concerning the circumstances in a pandemic era considering COVID-19 as the case study. The study was done with remote IT workers in Sri Lanka who work as a part of a software development team. 481 professionals participated in the study and were selected based on selection criteria and appropriate encoding techniques were utilized to encode categorical variables where most important 25 features were detected among 60 features using feature selection. Finally, classification techniques such as Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, CatBoost, decision tree, and NaÃ¯ve Bayes were used for modeling by which the CatBoost algorithm in overall measures outperformed other algorithms with a predictive accuracy of 97.1%, precision of 97.4%, recall of 99.7%, and f1 measure is 98.5%.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-7375-0","10.1109/SCSE56529.2022.9905229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9905229","classification;external features;IT employees;Machine Learning;mental distress","COVID-19;Support vector machines;Machine learning algorithms;Pandemics;Psychology;Feature extraction;Prediction algorithms","","5","","16","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, after the COVID-19 pandemic, e-learning is the only available solution to continue teaching during the lockdown periods. The evolution of these studies also needs to adapt to the situation. One of the significant issues with this online evaluation method is the anomalies during the evaluation process. This proposed implementation mainly focuses on anomaly detection of the Moodle environment exam systems. The proposed system produces a Moodle plugin to detect the time taken for each question in the Moodle environment examination system and detect the exam anomalies using the time variations. Then analyze and calculate the time that each candidate has taken for each question and the average time. The invigilator can see the candidates who took more than average time and less than average time and get the suspicious candidate list. The plugin also contains a separate algorithm that monitors the candidate while facing the exam. This face detection algorithm will notice the unusual behaviours of the candidate and upload the created report to the database, and the invigilator can access these reports on their loggings. To guide the candidate system, they also have an AI agent who will help to understand the exam process, give pre-defined answers for the questions, and provide contact details of the relevant authorities for exceptional cases. Also, the developed plugin detects the system information and background apps that run during the exam process and automatically creates relevant reports, and uploads them into the database. After the system implementation, the system was tested using a selected audience.

This paper proposes a mathematical model to minimize the total cost through proactive lateral transhipment while reducing the stockouts, significantly. A multi-item, multi-location inventory system was considered, and a cost minimization model was developed based on the tradeoff between the potential gain and the transhipment cost. The model was implemented using Python programming language and validated using a real-world data set from one of the leading supermarket chains.

Therefore, this study has been conducted to optimize transportation cost and distance of combined first-mile pickup and last-mile delivery operations while meeting some practical requirements such as a variety of package types, package compatibility on different types of vehicles, and a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles. After a careful literature review, this paper introduces a mathematical model to optimize the simultaneous first-mile pickup and last-mile delivery. The proposed mathematical model was simulated in SupplyChainGuruÂ® modelling and simulation software. The study concluded that when first-mile pickup and last-mile delivery are routed simultaneously, rather than distributing and collecting the products as two separate operations, the overall cost is minimized by about 34%, and the distance is reduced by about 42% while reducing the number of vehicles on the route and utilising the maximum possible capacity of vehicles.

In total, 12 key success factors were obtained, and those factors were grouped into three categories: operational, economical and environmental factors. A conceptual model is developed to identify the relationship between the warehousing critical success factors and warehousing performance. The study reveals the lack of attention paid to warehouse performance criteria along with warehouse management factors. The findings of this study could inspire the decision-makers who wish to improve the 3PL industry performance while improving warehouse performance in the 3PL industry in Sri Lanka.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-7375-0","10.1109/SCSE56529.2022.9905116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9905116","labour productivity;space utilisation;third-party logistics;warehouse performance","Industries;Systematics;Bibliographies;Aggregates;Warehousing;Supply chains;Focusing","","1","","23","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Frightening levels of the spread of Coronsvirus-19 (COVID-19) have captured the attention of the apparel industry not only locally but globally. During this epidemic crisis, identifying the factors that affect the employeesâ€™ workplace burden in the apparel industry is vital to the GDP of a country like Sri Lanka, as the economy of the country relies on growth in the Sri Lankan apparel sector. Each workplace burden has a distinct impact on employeesâ€™ job performance. The objective of this study is to determine how the intensity of the COVID-19 epidemic affects employeesâ€™ workplace burden and performance. Thereby assisting policymakers in responding to how to overcome the workplace burdens of the employees during this epidemic crisis. A mixed research approach, with both qualitative and quantitative data analysis, was used in the research. Considering the past literature and the industry expertsâ€™ opinions, factors related to workforce burden due to COVID-19 were identified and categorised into four categories. Partial Least Square (PLS) was used to analyse the relationship between the workforce burden factors and employee performance during the COVID-19 pandemic period. As the ultimate findings under the data analysis, exposure to COVIDâ€“19 and workplace preparation and work-related relationships have a significant positive impact on employeesâ€™ performance. The workload has a significant negative impact on the behaviour and results-based employeesâ€™ performance that has no significant impact on trait-based performance. Job-related uncertainty in the future has no significant impact on employeesâ€™ performance. Improving workplace safety regulations, developing online employee interactions, and increasing immediate management attention to employees are some of the suggestions to mitigate identified workplace burdens. The findings of this study related to the factors affecting workplace burdens must be addressed promptly by policymakers or employers in the Sri Lankan apparel sector to improve employeesâ€™ performance and, ultimately, industry performance. The outcome of this research would be useful in the future when a pandemic situation arises.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-7375-0","10.1109/SCSE56529.2022.9905176","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9905176","apparel sector employees;COVID-19 pandemic;workplace burden","COVID-19;Industries;Data analysis;Uncertainty;Pandemics;Economic indicators;Employment","","2","","25","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The green supply chain concept is introduced to alleviate environmental degradation and control air, water, and waste pollution through the adoption of green practices in business processes. In the last few decades, sustainability issues have gained the increasing interest of society. Further, the corporate world has taken sustainable development as a promising criterion for achieving a wealthier world in which natural resources and the environment are preserved for future generations. Despite increasing interest in environmental issues, most industries have considered and addressed green supply chain management and practices. However, a comprehensive and updated assessment of the third-party logistics industry in the literature is still missing. The main objective of this study is to identify the Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) drivers, initiatives, and performances which have a vital impact on reducing the adverse effect on the environment. To implement the GSCM initiatives, a survey was carried out with the experts in the third-party logistics companies in Sri Lanka. This study emphasizes that some factors of green drivers strongly influence the driver-initiative relationship, and the initiative factors strongly influence the initiative-performance relationship. The findings of this study are useful for managers in the supply chain and logistic domain and for policymakers, who could be inspired by the role of drivers in the implementation of GSCM initiatives, and then the initiatives on the level of performance achievable and thereby reduce the global warming and reduce the pollution to the environment.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-7375-0","10.1109/SCSE56529.2022.9905183","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9905183","green drivers;green initiatives;green supply chain management;performance;sustainability","Industries;Pollution;Supply chain management;Environmentally friendly manufacturing techniques;Green products;Supply chains;Government","","","","27","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study was conducted to identify and prioritize barriers to GSCM adoption in Sri Lankan RPMI and to find out the inter-relationships among barriers and GSCM practices. Through the literature review and expert opinions, eight barriers and five GSCM practices were identified and finalized. DEMATEL (Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) was used to find cause and effect relationships and interrelationships among factors related to each GSCM practice. Findings showed that major existing barriers and their significant interrelationships differed depending on the GSCM practice. Lack of knowledge, skills and expertise, lack of information flow and lack of technology are the major existing barriers to adopting GSCM practices in Sri Lankan RPMI.

Due to the nature and magnitude of the pandemic, many commonly practiced supply chain practices became impractical, highlighting the importance of building up resilience in the supply chain network to enable them to operate effectively in uncertain conditions. In an organizational context, modern-day supply chains are prone to experience quick disruptions because of their inherent complexity. Due to the nature of the Sri Lankan economy, the scope of disruption to trade and the ripple effect of disruptions to associated industries would be different from those of developed nations. The objective of this study is to understand the concept of supply chain resilience and its applicability when facing a critical disruptive force such as a pandemic. A thorough literature review and interviews were conducted with leading FMCG companies in Sri Lanka to determine how supply chain resilience could be achieved by overcoming the most critical risks encountered during a pandemic.

Supply chain network design (SCND) plays a major role in retail distribution in determining the best ways to locate facilities in the SCs. 100% availability of facilities can be identified as the most common limitation of much research conducted in a similar context due to the vulnerability of facing disruptions. Disruptions in SC are considered differently in research and numerous strategies are applied. However, direct shipping from suppliers to retailers has not much been focused on by previous studies although it is abundant in practice. This study develops a model for SCND under disruptions considering the direct shipping from suppliers to the retailers in the distribution network considering different levels of disruptions that occurred at distribution centers (DC). Linear programming technique is used in python language to build up suggested optimization model. Results of the model show the optimum distribution networks to use in the different disruption situations such as partial disruptions to the DCs and full DC disruptions that minimize the costs considering direct shipment. Overall, direct shipment can use to optimize SCND not only under disruptions but also in general conditions with the identification of marginal values in different factors involved. Identification of the costs in DC failures using this method can be used to enhance the resiliency of the DCs according to their importance.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-7375-0","10.1109/SCSE56529.2022.9905180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9905180","optimization;retail distribution networks;supply chain disruptions;supply chain network design","Costs;Systematics;Sensitivity analysis;Distribution networks;Companies;Minimization;Systems engineering and theory","","","","17","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
