Morning surge is a sudden increase in blood pressure from awakening or before awakening. Morning surge is implicated in cardiovascular diseases, such as Stroke, Angina Pectoris, and Myocardial Infarction. Morning surge has been detected mainly by the ABPM (Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring) method, which measures blood pressure for 24-hours. Since the ABPM method cannot distinguish awakening and sleep automatically, their alternative method is forcibly delimiting time or manually processing based on behaviour records. Therefore, it is necessary to capture the blood pressure change under clear sleep separation. This paper employs two sleep criteria for accurate blood pressure during sleep.","2613-8662","978-1-7281-7249-1","10.1109/SCSE49731.2020.9313008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9313008","Blood pressure;Clustering;Hypertension;Machine learning;Unsupervised learning","Blood pressure;Biomedical monitoring;Hypertension;Surges;Blood;Pressure measurement;Sleep apnea","","","","24","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A blind person should touch every Braille letter by his or her fingers. Therefore, high sensitivity in fingers and memorizing every Braille letters are key factors in Braille reading. Due to enhancement in technology, several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems have been introduced for different languages in different parts of the world. However, in Sri Lanka, there are no systems that extract Sinhala or English Braille characters using OCR and convert those Braille codes to sound output. The main purpose of the research is to create a system that extracts both Sinhala and English Braille segments from a given Braille document and makes the Braille content into voice. At the beginning Embossed Sinhala or English Braille image which took from webcam or a high-resolution phone will use for image processing techniques such as gray scaling, thresholding, erosion, and dilation. Erosion and gray scaling help to eliminate the noise and the noise-free image used to detect contour. After pre-processing, the image using an OpenCV library do the segmentation and character extraction. Braille character recognition has done by taking binary to decimal equivalent numbers. Before generating voice output, recognized Braille letters should convert to corresponding language letters (either Sinhala letter or English) and mapping English letters can directly generate English words but in Sinhala need an additional step called Unicode Mapping to generate a Sinhala word. When a Braille document is in high quality, the system will reach for 95 percent accuracy level and generally, results have around 85.30 percent success rate. This software provides many usability characteristics to increase simplicity when it's using OpenCV and related technologies. Even teachers can use this to improve their teaching terminologies and explain things more clearly in their lessons.","2613-8662","978-1-7281-7249-1","10.1109/SCSE49731.2020.9313020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9313020","Braille letters;Image processing;OCR;Segmentation;Unicode mapping","Image processing;Libraries;Kernel;Image segmentation;Blindness;Thresholding (Imaging);Optical character recognition software","","3","","10","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the high multifaceted nature of the language, it sets aside extensive effort to physically edit the substance of a composed setting. The necessity to overcome this problem has risen numerous years back. But with the complexity of grammar rules in morphologically lavish Sinhala language, the accuracy of the grammar checkers developed so far has been contrastingly lower and thus, to overcome the issue a novel hybrid approach has been introduced. Spell checked Sinhala active sentences being preprocessed, separated nouns and verbs were analyzed with the help of a resourceful part-of-speech-tagger and a morphological analyzer and alongside the sentences were sent through a pattern recognition mechanism to identify its sentence pattern. Then a decision tree-based algorithm has been used to evaluate the verb with the “subject” and output feedback about the correctness of the sentence. To train this decision tree, a dataset consisting of 800 records which included information about 25 predefined grammar rules in Sinhala was used. Finally, the error correction was provided using a machine learning algorithm-based sentence guessing model for the three possible tenses. Conducted research results paved the way to identify the sentence pattern, grammar rules and finally, suggest corrections for identified incorrect grammatical sentences with an acceptable accuracy rate of 88.6 percent which concluded that the proposed hybrid approach was an accurate approach for detecting and correcting grammatical mistakes in Sinhala text.","2613-8662","978-1-7281-7249-1","10.1109/SCSE49731.2020.9313051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9313051","Grammar checking;Hybrid approach;Part-of-speechtagger","Grammar;Modeling;Syntactics;Periodic structures;Machine learning algorithms;Linguistics;Tools","","7","","49","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Reducing the errors which can be happened by the driver when deciding all these stuff in instinct is the goal of the “Automated Vehicle Overtaking System”. This research has been used three pipelines, such as lane line detection, traffic sign detection, and vehicle detection.

This disease is mainly spread by the mosquito vector called `Aedes'. In Sri Lanka, the number of infected patients reported is increasing, and it has become a public health problem. Health Inspectors are using different methods to reduce the spread of this viral disease and one of the main methods used is the fumigation by identifying the Aedes Larvae breeding locations. Currently, this identification is done manually by the specialized health inspectors and it is totally observer-biased and consumes a considerable amount of time, which could lead to false decision making and inefficient identification. The purpose of this research is to build an automated computational model to identify Aedes Larvae in real-time with more accuracy and convenience. Even though there are good results in previous researches done in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on Aedes Larvae identification, the method of capturing Larvae Images is a bit complicated since they have used a Microscope lens of amplification capacity 60-100 times to get the magnified images. In this research, we propose the method of identifying Aedes mosquito larvae with a digital amplification of 8-12 times without using any microscope lenses attached, using ResNet50 CNN. The proposed model will identity the mosquito larvae by their genus `Aedes' or `non- Aedes' using a digital photo taken by a smartphone or camera in the upside of the larvae body. Hence it would help Health Inspectors, even the general public on identifying Aedes Larvae more efficiently, accurately and conveniently than the traditional method. This study shows that the trained model can identify images of Aedes and Non-Aedes Larvae separately with an accuracy of 86.65%. Furthermore, with using pre-processing techniques, the accuracy level can be enhanced to 98.76% for magnified images.","2613-8662","978-1-7281-7249-1","10.1109/SCSE49731.2020.9313003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9313003","Aedes larvae;Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN);Dengue;Larvae classification;Mosquito","Microscopy;Training;Modeling;Image color analysis;Diseases;Agriculture;Observers","","6","","12","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This helps to the quality improvement of the software and maintenance process of the software through a long time period without any obstacle. Therefore, software complexity metrics have been introduced to calculate the complexity of a software using numerical values. While there are number of metrics which calculate the complexity of object-oriented programs, they only consider one or two object-oriented concepts. As a result of that, there is no single metric which has the capability of measuring the complexity of a program based on multiple object-oriented concepts. This research aims to build a new metric to evaluate the complexity of an object-oriented program in order to improve the readability. The new metric has been built based on the influence of previous object-oriented metrics and some disregarded factors in calculating the complexity. In order to evaluate the new metric, Weyuker's properties and Briand's properties are used. The new metric acquires most of the object-oriented concepts in calculating the complexity and helps to improve the readability of the software as well. In fact, it makes it easy to handle the maintainability, reusability, portability and reliability of the software, when readability is high. This will result in increasing the overall software quality.","2613-8662","978-1-7281-7249-1","10.1109/SCSE49731.2020.9313049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9313049","Basic Control Structures (BCS);Cognitive complexity;Object-Oriented Software","Complexity theory;Measurement;Software;Object oriented programming;Weight measurement;Process control;Position measurement","","2","","15","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nonetheless, it can be harder to achieve consistent engagement with the customers round the clock and therefore many businesses have paved their focus in using a variety of solutions in overcoming this scenario. Contextual assistants that can have both linear and non-linear conversations with humans implicitly plays a prominent role in such situations. In contrast to resource-rich languages, creating a contextual assistant for resource-poor languages like Sinhala has been difficult mainly due to the unavailability of a rich digital footprint and the complexity of the language. Hence, this research was conducted to propose and implement a novel and common architecture of a contextual assistant framework for the Sinhala language. Here we have used a deep learning Intent Mapping (IM) model to map the consumer response to a predefined “Intent” and a Feature Extraction Mechanism (FEM) to extract related information from the input text. A set of data types for this framework were defined and FEM was trained to identify them efficiently. The IM model gave an accuracy output of 89.67 percent.

The distributed operation and dynamic topology have encouraged MANETs to be applied for establishing communication in unstable environments. MANET's dynamic topology and mobility have been very advantageous in the fields of military and disaster management. These dynamic characteristics of a MANET also create a major challenge in managing trust between the mobile nodes. Managing the trustworthiness of information that a node provides to the rest of the MANET is very crucial as misinformation spread can lead to erroneous decision making. Although previous studies have been carried out on trust management in MANETs using price-based and reputation systems, the potential of a globally distributed system has not been utilized practically. Therefore, these systems address the trust management issue within a boundary of a single MANET. Above mentioned systems should be re-evaluated when a node from another MANET joins a new MANET as the reputations of the node in the previous MANET cannot be imported to the new MANET. Lack of a possible solution for this gap may result in misinformation spreading by a malicious node before other nodes determine its reputation, which could be very dangerous in sensitive environments. Therefore, a globally distributed reputation model is a timely need in mobile ad-hoc networking. Blockchain technology is one of the most suitable technologies in present for its immutable and distributed properties to build robust systems. Blockchain is a distributed ledger, that has the ability to store feedback from mobile nodes about the accuracy of information provided by other nodes. A trust factor for each node can be calculated using these feedbacks. A mobile node can then decide whether to trust information, based on nodes’ trust factors. Adopting a development-oriented research methodology, a blockchain based reputation model prototype has been implemented and validated within the study.","2613-8662","978-1-7281-7249-1","10.1109/SCSE49731.2020.9312998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9312998","Blockchain;Mobile ad-hoc networks;Security;Trust management","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Blockchain;Trust management;Peer-to-peer computing;Smart contracts;Network topology","","4","","12","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Automated security systems are an integral part of smart homes. Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) is one of the popular fuels used in domestic cooking. Therefore, there is a very high demand for LPG fire security systems. In this study, an automated LPG fire security system for domestic gas leakages has been designed and a prototype model is constructed. The designed system automatically takes preventive measures in case of gas leakage. It includes a newly designed automatically disconnecting regulator from the cylinder which shuts OFF gas supply from commercially available gas cylinders, a control circuit for switching OFF the power supply of nearby area of gas leakage and transceiver unit for sending SMS to the corresponding people. It has been designed to operate automatically when LPG concentration reaches to 200 PPM, a value well below the LPG gas inflammable concentration. LPG concentration is sensed by the MQ-5 gas sensor and fed into the microcontroller. The commercially available gas regulator is modified by attaching a spring and solenoid valve. The spring is compressed when the regulator is ON. Once an LPG leakage of appropriate PPM is detected, a pulse is sent to the solenoid valve such that the attached spring gets rest by removing the regulator from the cylinder. At the same time, a warning message will automatically send to the corresponding users and security personnel through a GSM module attached to the circuit. The circuit is embedded with a rechargeable battery to work even in power outage. Additional gas sensors are installed in electrical switches located near to the gas cylinder and kept in connection with the microcontroller through the Bluetooth module to cutoff electrical power to prevent any spark.","2613-8662","978-1-7281-7249-1","10.1109/SCSE49731.2020.9312996","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9312996","Bluetooth;Gas sensor;GSM;IoT;Smart home;Solenoid","Switching circuits;Safety;Microcontrollers;Gas detectors;Bluetooth;Regulators;Control systems","","2","","14","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cloud computing interconnects data and applications served from multiple geographic locations. A large number of transactions and the hidden infrastructure in cloud computing systems have presented a number of challenges to the research community. Among them, maintaining the cloud network security has become a key challenge. For example, detecting anomalous data has been a key research area in cloud computing. Anomaly detection (or outlier detection) is the identification of suspicious or uncommon data that significantly differs from the majority of the data. Recently, machine learning methods have shown their effectiveness in anomaly detection. However, identifying anomalies or outliers using supervised learning methods still a challenging task due to the class imbalance and the unpredictable nature and inconsistent properties or patterns of anomaly data. One-class classifiers are one feasible solution for this issue. In this paper, we mainly focused on analyzing cloud network data for identifying anomalies using one-class classification methods namely One Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) and Autoencoder. Here, we used a benchmark data set, YAHOO Synthetic cloud network data set. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that used YAHOO data for detecting anomalies. According to our analysis, Autoencoder achieves 96.02 percent accuracy in detecting outliers and OCSVM achieves 79.05 percent accuracy. In addition, we further investigated the effectiveness of a one class classification method using another benchmarked data set, UNSW-NB15. There we obtained 99.10 percent accuracy for Autoencoder and 60.89 percent accuracy for OCSVM. The above results show the neural network-based methods perform better than the kernel-based methods in anomaly detection in cloud network data.","2613-8662","978-1-7281-7249-1","10.1109/SCSE49731.2020.9313014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9313014","Anomaly Detection;Cloud Computing;Machine Learning;One-Class Classification","Cloud computing;Anomaly detection;Data models;Modeling;Security;Machine learning;Support vector machines","","3","","20","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The overall objective of this research is to mitigate fraudulent activities in land authentication systems through the blockchain-based technological approach. A prototype of a smart contract based model has been created and verified with the involvement of the actual users. Since the smart contract-based land authentication model verifies the land ownership within a short period, the transaction processing time narrows down from a few months to a couple of minutes.

Therefore, transaction fees decrease drastically. Using consortium blockchain concept, these fees can be further minimized when proof of work is also handled by a set of approved entities. In this study, an Ethereum based micro-transaction model is proposed to be implemented within the ticketing system in Sri Lankan public transport sector. Bus tickets are programmed as Ethereum smart contracts to handle the payment distribution. Consortium blockchain concept is used in the blockchain-based model where there are regulated bodies as nodes such as the national transport commission to handle the proof of work. Digital currency and Quick Response (QR) codes are incorporated to identify and complete the transaction process. The methodology of this development-oriented research can be described under three major phases. In the first phase, interviews were carried out with relevant stakeholders to identify the process of the current system and its limitations. Also, a broad and extensive study of literature was done parallel to this. During the second phase, identified issues, limitations and downfalls were addressed by designing a novel architecture. In the final phase a prototype is being developed to demonstrate the architecture, In the final phase a prototype is being developed to demonstrate the architecture, then prototype validation and testing were done with simulated data and several key use cases in the domain. The preliminary results of the prototype model show signs of considerable improvement in the service level of the public transport ticketing process and a significant reduction of transaction fees.","2613-8662","978-1-7281-7249-1","10.1109/SCSE49731.2020.9313037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9313037","Consortium blockchains;Ethereum;Micro-payments;Smart contracts;Transportation","Blockchain;Public transportation;Smart contracts;Rail transportation;Peer-to-peer computing;Companies;Prototypes","","4","","15","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The language is the most common factor to divide humans and animals. Numerous classification techniques can be used for classification purposes, and the classification commonly can be done acoustically and visually. The classification systems are playing a considerable role, and bioacoustics monitoring was a significant field of study. Visual classification of animals is done by using either satellite images or established camera images. Nevertheless, due to some circumstances, image processing techniques cannot be applied. Then the acoustical classification techniques are taken place to encounter those problems. Even with acoustical methods, a remote observing method is required due to a few issues. Applying an IoT based acoustic classification system was designed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which is beneficial for those who are interested in monitoring ecosystems such as animal scientists, zoologists, and environmentalists. The hardware implementation was designed to collect the data from the place it was placed. The audio clips were preprocessed using the Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC). A CNN architecture based on TensorFlow was used for the training process. To train and test the network, 400 sound clips of two seconds, such that 40 per each ten animal species, which were gathered from online libraries and formatted using Audacity, were used. The network was trained by changing the different gradient descent optimizers and eventually obtained the confusion matrices for each. The best result was gained by the AdaDelta, Gradient Descent, and RMSProp optimizers with 91.3% accuracy for each. Among them, AdaDelta had the most stable and increasing learning approach.

Social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram have acquired their user's attraction by maintaining their identity with very similar features. With the popularity of these platforms, now a day most of the users tend to rely on the information published on social media. Therefore, the credibility of social media information is playing a major role in the present cyberspace. As an example, the Twitter platform is handling 500 million tweets per day. Most of the twitter messages are truthful, but the twitter platform is also used to spread rumors and misinformation. Truthfulness or reliability is depending on the source's credibility. Twitter profiles can be identified as the information source on the twitter platform. In this paper, a user reputation-based prediction method is proposed to analyze the twitter source credibility. The proposed solution is mainly based on the k-means clustering model. Another two models namely, news category analysis and sentiment analysis are deployed to generate novel features for the clustering method. The objective of this paper is to introduce a credibility rating method to visualize the user credibility of twitter user profiles. So that followers can have an understanding about the trustworthiness of the information published on that profile.

Religious extremism is the advocacy of extreme measures over a religion whereas religious extremists are even willing to murder as they provide sanctions for violence in the service of God. Sri Lanka has a tragic history of religious and ethnic extremism and the Easter Sunday attack coordinated by a radical Islamic group that killed over 300 and injured another several hundred can be identified as the recent climax of these events. In this modern information age, it is evident that these radical extremist groups utilize social media for spreading their extreme ideologies due to its free and unregulated nature. If there were a mechanism to even slightly identify the possibility of tragic incidents like Easter Sunday bombing, the 300 souls who had to sacrifice their lives for an unreasonable cause would be still alive happily. In this research, we propose a predictive methodology for identifying any upcoming religious extremism-based threats in Sri Lanka using social media intelligence. We aim to specifically address Sri Lanka’s multi-lingual culture by analyzing all the bilingual social media posts in Sinhala and Tamil languages. A hybrid sentiment analysis methodology consisting of a Machine Learning model and a sentiment lexicon was trained on carefully chosen labelled social media text data and each text was classified as either religious-extreme or not, using Naïve Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest algorithms. When comparing their results, we were able to achieve the best results with the Naïve Bayes algorithm resulting in an accuracy of 81% for Sinhala tweets while Random Forest algorithm resulted in an accuracy of 73% for Tamil tweets proving that social media intelligence can be used to predict religious extremism-based threats.","2613-8662","978-1-7281-7249-1","10.1109/SCSE49731.2020.9313010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9313010","Machine learning;Religious extremism;Social media;Text analytics","Social networking (online);Blogs;Sentiment analysis;Feature extraction;Terrorism;Analytical models;Tagging","","5","","18","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this theory is far more complicated. This allows people to take charge of their own learning. It involves awareness of how they learn, and evaluation of their learning needs, generating strategies to meet these needs and then implementing the strategies. The theory of metacognition can be identified as humans' survival instinct. Metacognition also thinks about one's thinking process such as study skills, memory capabilities, and the ability to monitor learning [2],[3]. Metacognition refers to higher-order thinking which involves active control over the cognitive processes engaged in learning. This concept needs to be explicitly taught along with content instruction. Metacognitive knowledge is about our cognitive processes and our understanding of how to regulate those processes to maximize learning. From ancient times humans have developed their metacognitive skills as a survival factor. For the survival in a video game, players need to follow instructions to get an idea about the gameplay [4]. But most of the time people are likely to skip the instructions without going through them even for the first time. This scenario is noticeable in mobile gameplay. This research has done to identify the factors which affect this dilemma. Metacognition level of a person and age are the variables that were considered for this experiment in order to address the following hypotheses; The more metacognitive skills people have, the more they will find it easy to play never-before-played games. Age range affects performance when it comes to playing the never-before-played games without direct instructions. At the end of this experiment, the first hypothesis became correct while the second one wasn't. Therefore, people were more likely to ignore direct instructions and go through gameplay successfully when they had a higher metacognitive level, and the age group didn't seem to affect this factor.","2613-8662","978-1-7281-7249-1","10.1109/SCSE49731.2020.9313016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9313016","Gameplay;Interface Design;Metacognition;Video games","Games;Task analysis;Mathematical model;Regulation;Education;Software engineering;Land mobile radio","","","","23","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are less number of applications have been developed to detect emotions online, using online comments and user comments. The aim of this research is to develop a system that identifies human emotions on Facebook comments. Among the different social media platforms, this research specifically focuses on Facebook comments written in the English language to narrow down the problem. The research is based on Semantic analysis, which comes under Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the system development consists of four major steps, including the extraction of Facebook comments via Graph API, preprocessing, classification and emotion detection. To classify the emotions, a classification model was created by using Naïve Bayes Algorithm. When it comes to marketing, emotions are what lead your onlookers to purchase. By using the detected emotions, marketers can promote their campaigns by changing online advertisements dynamically.

Therefore, a lot of Natural Language processing tools have been implemented to identify keywords in both structured and unstructured texts. Text that appears in social media platforms such as twitter is mostly unstructured because of the character limitation. Consequently, a lot of short terms and symbols such as emoticons and URLs are included in tweets. Keyword extraction from grammatically ambiguous text is not easy compared to structured text since it is hard to rely on the linguistic features in unstructured texts. But when it comes to news on twitter, it may contain somewhat structured text than informal text does but it depends on the tweeter, the person who posts the tweet. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to extract keywords from a given tweet to retrieve relevant news that has been posted on twitter, for fake news detection. The intention of extracting keywords is to find more related news efficiently and effectively. For this approach, a corpus that contains tweet texts from different domains is built in order to make this approach more generic instead of making it a domain-specific approach. In fact, the Stanford Core NLP tool kit, Wordnet linguistic database and statistical method are used for extracting keywords from a tweet. For the system evaluation, the Turing test which has human intervention is used.

We developed a new language emergence agent that combines a language module and a visual module and included the bias that exists in humans as a “reflection function” into the new emergence algorithm. We used the MNIST dataset for language emergence. Irrespective of the function, messages corresponding to the label of MNIST could be generated. However, through qualitative and quantitative analysis, we confirmed that the reflection function caused pattern structuring in the message.

Null values and noise have treated with a binning method. In the second phase, feature engineering had carried out so categorical variables are in numerically manner. Therefore, the binary encoding was used for categorical. Finally, the dimensionality reduction of the processed data had done using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract the most prominent and customer explanatory attributes within the SME. The PCA yielded 10% of a reduction in total explained variance percentage, meaning that the data had compressed. Using K-Means clustering 4 distinctive clusters were extracted. The usage of PCA had leveraged quick clustering and obtained 4 clusters represented the most impactful customers between the age of 0-17 and occupational level 10.

Nowadays, the rate of accident occurrence in Colombo-Katunayake Expressway is high compared to the other two expressways and there was no previous research has been done in Sri Lanka regarding accidents on Colombo-Katunayake expressway. Therefore, the objective of the study was to identify the factors contributing to accidents on the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway and to develop appropriate machine learning models to classify the severity of the accidents. In this study, 704 total accident cases were considered during the period 2013-2019. Chi-square test, logistic regression, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to identify the association between the accident severity and other influential variables found from the literature. Finally, seven variables: time category, driver’s age category, vehicle type, the reason for the accident, number of vehicles involved, cause for accident and rainfall were identified as influencing variables to accident severity under 5% level of significance. Naïve Bayes classification algorithm and probabilistic neural network (PNN) were used in the study to forecast accident severity. A random under-sampling technique was used to overcome the class imbalanced problem persists in the data set considered in the study. The final models developed using the Naïve Bayes algorithm and PNN exhibit 72.14% and 74.29% overall classification accuracy respectively. Both aforementioned models can be considered as suitable models to forecast accident severity in the Colombo-Katunayake expressway where the PNN model exhibits slightly higher accuracy.

Hence this scrutiny proposes a model to assess the current level of readiness of the Sri Lankan apparel industry to adapt Industry 4.0 technologies and practices. The model was developed based on a systematic review of literature with the industry experts' guidance. The factors that determine the readiness for Industry 4.0 within an organizational context were classified under four categories; People, Process, Technology and Data which were defined as readiness dimensions. The proposed model consists of five readiness levels from 0 to 4 namely: Stranger, Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced and Elite. This model enables managers to measure the readiness for adapting of Industry 4.0 in selected apparel value chain processes by using the specified minimum requirements under each dimension and level. The outcome of this study indicates that Sri Lankan apparel industry is in “Intermediate” level in terms of overall readiness with a value of1.91 in the predefined readiness scale from 0 to 4.","2613-8662","978-1-7281-7249-1","10.1109/SCSE49731.2020.9313026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9313026","Apparel 4.0;Apparel value chain Industry 4.0;Readiness assessment;Sri Lankan apparel industry","Industries;Modeling;Companies;Adaptation models;Standards organizations;Systematics;Real-time systems","","6","","45","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A solution to overcome speech disorder of patients using Brain Neuron EEG Signals","J. A. D. T Jayawickrama; S.

Most of the people who are suffering from speech disorders encounter difficulties in professional communication. Since people are busy with their day to day life, it is not practical to spend more time in consulting a doctor or do speech therapies for their medical issues. The speech therapist generally charges a significantly much higher rate for a single speech therapy practice, which the patient needs to practice at least twice or more for a week to get a better result. In an economy like Sri Lanka, people with average income cannot afford such an amount of money. Therefore, an innovative desktop application for speech disorder patients to overcome this problem has arisen. The main aim of this application is to reduce the speech imperative percentage of speech disorder patients via capturing the electroencephalogram feed of speech motor (Broca's area) using brain neuron O1, O2, C3, C4, F3, F4, F7, F8 electrodes and analyzing it to identify speech imperative issues. This system identifies the current impact on the left hemisphere of the brain (Broca's area) using EEG neurofeedback. Using speech voice analysis, the system provides the user to measure the articulation interference of the speech process. Self-Learning video tutorials are available for the clinical practices and treatments are available as prolong, relaxing, and humming exercises. Patients can track down the improvements daily or monthly by the rating system which makes the system unique among all other systems and the result can be directly sent to the desired consultant/neurophysiologist by the system itself. Patients can save time and the total cost of a therapy fee by using this system.","2613-8662","978-1-7281-7249-1","10.1109/SCSE49731.2020.9312997","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9312997","Automated interface;Brain neuron waves;Self-learning video therapies;Speech disorders;Voice analysis algorithm","Electroencephalography;Videos;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Positron emission tomography;Neurons;Interviews;Encephalography","","1","","18","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The development effort of a software project depends on various factors and these effort factors associated with the freelance software development are different from those of traditional software development. Software development companies employ various proprietary tools in their projects for their planning, development, testing, etc. However, freelance software developers functioning under tight budgetary constraints are not in a position to afford them. As a result, they tend to use free and open-source tools for their software developments. There are various types of software effort estimation models proposed, published and practiced in the industry. However, there is no such software effort estimation model specifically proposed to estimate the effort of freelance software development. The main objective of this paper is to extend Use Case Point-based software effort estimation for the open-source freelance software development. Initially, details of open source software projects were collected from several freelance software developers. Based on the use case diagrams, Use Case Points counts are then calculated for each project. Taking other effort drivers associated with open source freelance software development also into account, we then estimate the effort of each software development. Our aim is to explore the viability of using Use Case Points as the main effort driver in estimating the effort of open source freelance software development.","2613-8662","978-1-7281-7249-1","10.1109/SCSE49731.2020.9313007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9313007","Freelance software developers;Open source software development;Software effort estimation;Use Case points","Software;Estimation;Tools;Software measurement;Size measurement;Open source software;Modeling","","1","","23","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The success of primary education is measured by conducting a scholarship examination. Those who are getting higher results are given opportunities to attend well-facilitated schools for secondary education. Due to that case, there is a massive competition for passing the examination. Limitless pressure for examination provides lots of issues to students. This paper uses data to investigate a model of academic performance as measured by past results of school tests of Grade 4 and Grade 5. 500 students from eight primary schools in the Gampaha district have been selected for collecting data. The Data on the above-mentioned students have been collected by conducting questionnaires to the teachers who in-charged the classes. Then the Logistic Regression model and Multiple Linear Regression model have been applied to predict students' performances at the examination. The model depicts the likelihood of a student passing or failing the grade 5 scholarship examination and predicts the range of results that students will obtain in the examination. The accuracy of predictive models is measured using the results of students who have already faced the Grade 5 examination. Revealing the potential of students at the grade 5 examination is heavily benefited by teachers because they can provide personalized education for talented students and provide opportunities to other students to improve their talents. The initial architecture of the Grade 5 examination results' predictive model is being discussed in this paper.","2613-8662","978-1-7281-7249-1","10.1109/SCSE49731.2020.9313029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9313029","Academic Performance Predicting;Logistic Regression;Machine Learning;Multiple Linear Regression","Education;Scholarships;Government;Predictive models;Data mining;Predictive analytics;Training","","","","24","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are different challenges associated with it. Many works have been done in order to provide solutions for key challenges. This study of work is focused on melanoma detection by using Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Colour textures, and Diameter (ABCD) feature along with proposing two new approaches for border irregularity detection. The proposed two new approaches are distance difference method and gradient method, which follows the main concept as traversing along the continuous borderline of the lesion. Further, this study varies from the existing studies, since it has been taken counts of distances from the centroid to the borderline without considering the distance from the image border to the borderline of the lesion. It was able to achieve a classification rate of 79% and 78.5% using distance difference method and gradient method, respectively whereas the classification without the border irregularity feature achieved 78% of accuracy performing on PH2 dataset. Further, this study can be stated as most appropriate to classify non-melanoma rather than melanoma. It is contributed by generating simple computer science-based approaches rather than complex mathematical methods to detect border irregularity and makes the medical image detection easy.","2613-8662","978-1-7281-7249-1","10.1109/SCSE49731.2020.9313042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9313042","ABCD features;Border irregularity;Distance difference method;Gradient method;Medical image detection;Melanoma and non-melanoma classification","Melanoma;Lesions;Feature extraction;Skin;Medical diagnostic imaging;Image segmentation;Image edge detection","","4","","16","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sri Lanka is still titled as a country with an agricultural-based economy and thus identifying the impact of climate variability on agriculture is very important. However, previous studies reveal a little information in the context of Sri Lanka on the impact of climate variabilities on agriculture. Therefore, this study showcases an artificial neural network (ANN) framework; that is an ordinary machine learning algorithm based on the model of the human neuron system, to evaluate the relationships among the climatic components and the paddy harvest in the North-Western province of Sri Lanka. This on-going study helps to analyze the relationships between the paddy harvest of the North-Western province and climate, including rainfall minimum atmospheric temperature and maximum atmospheric temperature. Correlation coefficient (R) and mean squared error (MSE) are used to test the performance of the ANN model. The results obtained from the analysis revealed that the predicted and real paddy yields have a significant correlation with rainfall, maximum temperature and minimum temperature.","2613-8662","978-1-7281-7249-1","10.1109/SCSE49731.2020.9313047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9313047","Artificial Neural Network (ANN);LM algorithm;North-Western province;Paddy yield;Rainfall;Temperature","Artificial neural networks;Meteorology;Predictive models;Temperature measurement;Analytical models;Ocean temperature;Correlation coefficient","","","","17","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Reviews can be vital for manufacturers to get insights into consumer opinions and consumers in their purchase decisions. Sentiment analysis, referring to the extraction of subjective opinions on a particular subject within a text, is a field within Natural Language Processing, that can convert this unstructured information hidden within reviews into structured information expressing public opinion. In regards to a specific product group like hair care products, certain brands are rising in the market due to their positive public opinion on particular aspects. While ecommerce websites facilitate users to view the reviews, they do not display which reviews contain which type of opinion on which aspect at a glance. This research aims to introduce an automated process that focuses on determining the polarity of online consumer reviews on different aspects of hair care products by using Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis. The system consists of processes like data gathering, pre-processing, aspect extraction and polarity detection and follows a sequential approach to achieve the intended goal. Consequently, by deciphering the aspect-wise polarity of the reviews, the implemented system demonstrates an accuracy of 85% from the test data for overall aspects, enabling consumers to get an at a glance idea about the public opinion and manufacturers to identify their strong and weak points.","2613-8662","978-1-7281-7249-1","10.1109/SCSE49731.2020.9313040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9313040","Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis;Natural Language Processing;Opinion Mining;Sentiment Analysis;Supervised Learning","Sentiment analysis;Hair;Data mining;Classification algorithms;Business;Social networking (online);Feature extraction","","2","","11","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Gamification is one such innovative technology that has been gaining popularity in recent times. This study aims to explore the application of Gamification in the context of Retail Marketing in Sri Lanka and ultimately propose a concept for a Gamified application that can be used by customers of moderntrade retailers. The study took an exploratory qualitative approach where intensive surveys of literature and in-depth interviews with a judgmental purposive sample of seven marketing professionals in the modern-trade retail industry were conducted to determine the current play of technology in retail marketing as well as the drivers & challenges of Gamification adoption. Further, in-depth interviews with the customers of such organizations were conducted in gathering user preferences and design recommendations for a Gamified app. Thematic analysis was carried out in deriving insights. Findings show that the retail firms currently employ several technologies in line with those discussed in existing literature such as loyalty card systems, digital signage, VR technologies, online Gamification amidst others in carrying out their marketing efforts. Gamification is predominantly applied in the online context as opposed to the offline (in-store) context. Furthermore, the key drivers that propel firms to implement novel technology like Gamification are to generate customer insights, enhance customer experience and achieve marketing related KPI targets. Conversely, inadequate technology infrastructure, justifying the focus on a niche crowd of tech-oriented customers and slow ROI pose as challenges in the process of Gamification adoption. Three main themes emerged upon exploring user preferences and design recommendations for a Gamified app and are identified as information at the touch of a fingerprint, automation & integration and use of game mechanics. Ultimately by incorporating these insights gathered, a concept for a Gamified app was proposed.","2613-8662","978-1-7281-7249-1","10.1109/SCSE49731.2020.9313039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9313039","Gamification;Marketing;Modern-trade retail;Technology","Games;Industries;Interviews;Internet of Things;Artificial intelligence;Task analysis;Social networking (online)","","1","","36","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
