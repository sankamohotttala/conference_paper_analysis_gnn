Detection of unusual human movement can be helpful for many domains, such as security, marketing, and health. A mobile dataset in Hiroshima, Japan between 2019-December to 2020-November was used for this research. The mobile dataset was converted to time series for multiple locations in Hiroshima, Japan. Since many different parameters are selected for time series, the message space multi-agent technique is used. Sub agents are introduced for duplicate removal, missing data replacement, and outlier detection. Multiple processing agents and a control agent were introduced to predict the missing values to improve the efficiency of the model. Finally, using the Seasonal-Trend decomposition techniques, unusual movements are identified, and unusual human movements are plotted with the holidays. Multiple outlier points were detected for all the locations, and there were more than a hundred outlier points were detected for the selected locations.","","979-8-3503-4737-1","10.1109/ICARC57651.2023.10145617","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10145617","Time Series Analysis;Human Movements;Outlier Detection;Multi-Agent Technique;Message Space Agent","Time series analysis;Process control;Machine learning;Predictive models;Aerospace electronics;Security;Object recognition","","1","","22","IEEE","12 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to prevent any unfavorable occurrences in life, it is crucial to understand human stress levels. Sleep disturbances are related to a number of physical, mental, and social problems. This study's main objective is to investigate how human stress might be detected using machine learning algorithms based on sleep-related behaviors. The obtained dataset includes various sleep habits and stress levels. Six machine learning techniques, including Multilayer Perception (MLP), Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees, Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression were utilized in the classification level after the data had been preprocessed in order to compare and obtain the most accurate results. Based on the experiment results, it can be concluded that the Naïve Bayes algorithm, when used to classify the data, can do so with 91.27% accuracy, high precision, recall, and f-measure values, as well as the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error rates (RMSE). We can estimate human stress levels using the study's findings, and we can address pertinent problems as soon as possible.","","979-8-3503-4737-1","10.1109/ICARC57651.2023.10145663","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10145663","Classification;Machine Learning;Sleeping Habits;Stress Detection","Support vector machines;Machine learning algorithms;Error analysis;Human factors;Nonhomogeneous media;Classification algorithms;Decision trees","","1","","15","IEEE","12 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Dynamic environments with static and dynamic obstacles are challenging areas in robotic implementations. In this proposed study, robotic exploration is presented in an unknown dynamic environment using Random Network Distillation(RND) algorithm, which was introduced for Atari games. RND algorithm is used here for robotic navigation depending on obstacle location and environmental features. The proposed route planning robot is implemented using the Robot Operating System(ROS) and the Gazebo simulator. In previous works, Deep Reinforcement Learning based agents have shown promising outcomes. However, the reward system needs to be more robust for this path-planning task. In order to unravel the sparse reward issue, a revised RND approach is suggested. In order to dynamically alter intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, this algorithm determines the variation of the training steps count in each training episode. Laser inputs from Gazebo are fed to the RND algorithm to get the actions. Actions will define by avoiding walls or obstacles. The robotic path and map are visualized on the Gazebo. The results show the robot's actions and combine intrinsic and extrinsic rewards from RND on the application. Further, employing the RND-trained agent learns to cover environments presented as a novel part of the research. Four simulations are conducted based on the environment to validate the algorithm, including without obstacles, static obstacles, dynamic obstacles, and both. The experimental results indicate that RND agents trained in different environments can reach the goal accurately without crashes.","","979-8-3503-4737-1","10.1109/ICARC57651.2023.10145730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10145730","ROS;Gazebo;RND;DQN;Robotic Path Planning;Reinforcement Learning;Turtle bot 3","Deep learning;Training;Visualization;Heuristic algorithms;Reinforcement learning;Games;Path planning","","3","","24","IEEE","12 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Regardless of the gravity of these incidents, existing policies and automated algorithms used by social media platforms failed to detect hate speech content in the Sinhala language. Further, only a few studies had been conducted to detect Sinhala hate speech due to the limited datasets available. In this paper, a new hate speech dataset consisting of 4168 annotated text data samples extracted from Twitter and Youtube platforms has been introduced. Further, five XLM-Rbase based fine-tuning strategies have been evaluated for Sinhala hate speech classification using the newly introduced Twitter-Youtube dataset and publicly available Kaggle dataset. XLMRbase model fine-tuned with bidirectional RNN layer has outperformed all the other fine-tuning strategies for both datasets.

Some of them like to read books for various reasons like as a hobby or to learn something new. At present, with modern technology, people have become accustomed to reading books online in addition to physically reading books. The most important factor in identifying which books are the most successful is the award-winning. The goal of this research is to forecast how the most successful books such as award/winning books are identified based on 10 distinct attributes including publishing date, average ratings, author, genre, language, publisher, number of pages, ratings, title, and reviews. A data set was gathered for this purpose through the online community platform Kaggle. The dataset provides information about books gathered from the website 'Goodread' for the period between 2000 and 2021. Firstly, the data set has been pre-processed. For that, duplicate data, unnecessary special characters, and missing values have been removed. To rank the preprocessed data, the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) data mining tool was utilized, and results are improved by hyperparameter tuning. The predictive model is generated using six machine learning approaches at the classification level: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes. A high accuracy of 86.32% was gained with the lowest error rates in addition to high precision, recall, and f-measure values using a Naive Bayes algorithm.

The likelihood that a melanoma patient would recover considerably increases with early detection. At present deep learning (DL) approaches are becoming popular in assisting early melanoma identification. Although DL techniques provide high performance, the utilization of an image classifier alone results in the low trustworthiness of the application and makes it challenging to grasp the reasoning behind model predictions. This emphasizes the requirement of justifying the decision in addition to the classifications with better performance. In contrast to existing black-box methods, this paper addresses the explainability of a classification. We present a computational model to classify melanoma skin cancer images by applying the Xception model for the HAM10000 dataset. With the retaining of batch-normalization layers and Bayesian hyperparameter search to fine-tune hyperparameters, this study shows a classification accuracy of 90.24%. Additionally, we generate heatmaps using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), and Grad-CAM++, for the explainability of the classification model, as a novel contribution to the domain of dermatology. The visualized heatmaps explain the contribution of each input region to the classification result.","","979-8-3503-4737-1","10.1109/ICARC57651.2023.10145622","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10145622","Transfer learning;Explainable AI;Xception;Grad-CAM;Grad-CAM++","Heating systems;Deep learning;Visualization;Computational modeling;Transfer learning;Dermatology;Melanoma","","6","","15","IEEE","12 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper compares intelligent systems with convolutional neural networks and fuzzy logic for emotion recognition applications. Two system scenarios have been discussed separately to check the detection accuracy of facial expression recognition in image classification and speech signal recognition. The results reveal that convolution neural networks perform emotion recognition activities with higher accuracy than fuzzy logic applications. These experimental results can be used for future research applications to develop intelligent systems regarding emotional identification for service robotics.

When it comes to Sri Lanka, the country's economy has grown primarily due to the tourism sector. Recently, the Covid-19 pandemic phase has had a significant negative impact on Sri Lanka's tourism industry. If we could recognize these problems, we would be able to prepare the tourism sector for future pandemics and ensure its stability. Studying peoples' opinions is crucial for taking the necessary measures, and Twitter is one of the greatest places to do this. This study suggests a model for categorizing tweets about the tourism sector during Covid-19 in Sri Lanka into four categories: positive, negative, commercial, and neutral. For this study, take into account 18980 tweets that were gathered on Twitter between the 2020 and 2022 time period. After selecting the 6257 tweets by prepossessing, the study extracts the feature vectors and result compares them using three different machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). These results in a forecast paradigm for sentiment analysis of the movement of the tourism industry. To build a model, 67% of training data sets and 33% of testing data sets were used. The findings showed that LSTM, ANN and SVM accuracy was 85%, 91%, and 76% respectively. Additionally, the study takes into account the evaluation results of precision, recall, f-measure, and error values. The ANN algorithm provides the greatest results for sentiment analysis for monitoring Sri Lanka's tourism industry movements, according to the final results.","","979-8-3503-4737-1","10.1109/ICARC57651.2023.10145708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10145708","Covid-19;Machine Learning;Sentiment Analysis;Tourism Industry;Twitter","COVID-19;Support vector machines;Sentiment analysis;Social networking (online);Pandemics;Tourism industry;Blogs","","1","","16","IEEE","12 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The diagnosis and treatment of CKD in its early stages are very important since patients can correct intermittent kidney function to halt the progression of this disease at this stage. And also, at this early stage, there are no obvious signs, and the cost of diagnosing and treating CKD is relatively significant, especially in developing countries like Sri Lanka. The CKD has had a severe impact on the residents of Anuradhapura district in Sri Lanka; the origin and exact aetiology are not yet fully understood. Recently, early CKD detection has been significantly supported by machine learning techniques. In this study, we developed a CKD detective system to diagnose chronic kidney diseases at any stage using efficient feature selection methods and machine learning based on the data collected from Anuradhapura district, Sri Lanka. Data pre-processing was performed, especially filling in missing values using the KNN imputation method with different K values. The correlation matrix, the variance inflation factor, and the wrapper feature selection methods are used to select the best sets of features in the CKD dataset for all K values. Four supervised machine learning algorithms were utilized to create the most accurate machine learning models. The Random Forest classification achieved the greatest accuracy (96%) of these machine learning techniques for the different K values. The proposed system could be implemented to detect CKD, especially in Sri Lanka, and ensure that the health and quality of life of the people are improved.","","979-8-3503-4737-1","10.1109/ICARC57651.2023.10145656","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10145656","Chronic Kidney Disease;KNN Imputation;Feature Selection;Machine Learning","Radio frequency;Support vector machines;Machine learning algorithms;Feature extraction;Chronic kidney disease;Filling;Numerical models","","2","","19","IEEE","12 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Red onion prices are fluctuating, and it is difficult to identify price patterns in Sri Lanka. In the Jaffna district, red onion cultivation farmers have been facing losses for the last ten years due to traditional price forecasting techniques. There are several factors influencing the price of red onions in the market. In the research on fertilizer prices, the big onion price, labour cost, rainfall, and United States dollar exchange were considered important to the red onion price for data pre-processing and modelling. The research aims to identify the correlation between factors and predict the price using different machine-learning techniques.

In practice, a specialized medical expert has to go through an X-Ray image to compile the accompanying report, which is tedious, not scalable, and potentially prone to human error. Therefore, automatic medical report generation (AMRG) solutions for CXR as a diagnostic assistance tool could play an important role in lowering the burden on radiologists, making them more productive. However, current AMRG solutions are still lagging far behind the performance of human experts due to the reasons such as the inability to extract the most relevant features to be used for the compilation of the report. We address this by proposing MERGIS: MEdical Report Generation using the Image Segmentation approach. MERGIS is a modern transformer-based encoder-decoder model that leverages image segmentation to improve the accuracy of automatic report generation. In this approach, the CXR images are segmented before feeding into the model, enabling the encoder to extract relevant visual features of the medical image resulting in more accurate radiography reports. The proposed model outperforms the current state-of-the-art model for report generation on the MIMIC-CXR dataset with performance scores: BLUE-1 = 0.296, METEOR = 0.128, ROUGE L = 0.335, and CIDEr = 1.150.","","979-8-3503-4737-1","10.1109/ICARC57651.2023.10145699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10145699","medical report generation;Chest X-Ray;transformer;image segmentation;self-attention","Image segmentation;Visualization;Computational modeling;MIMICs;Writing;Radiology;Transformers","","2","","14","IEEE","12 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, classifying the damaged and non-damaged characters in a degraded Sinhala handwritten document is di cult. The gradient-based clustering technique is the main approach for clustering the character segment pixels based on their gradient values. Boundary drawing around the damaged zone cluster approach leads to identifying the damaged locations of the character foreground areas and classifying the character as damaged or non-damaged.

Citizens use social media platforms to express their views and give their feedback through media platforms by sharing information and ideas about this social issue. This paper discusses the social influence of Twitter hate users and identifies the most influential hate users by ranking them. The analysis reveals that Eigenvector Centrality can find influential users, resulting in a ranking close to PageRank with little alterations. With more mentions and retweets during the crisis, the influence of hate users has increased. Furthermore, the network diameter and average path length indicate lower values while higher values are indicated by the average degree, average weighted degree, connected components, edges, and average cluster coefficient. There are more interpersonal connections, relationships, or ties among hate users now than there were before the crisis. Furthermore, hate users express more negative sentiments than positive ones.

Usage of EVs play a major role in the sustainable development approach of lifestyle. In the current scenario in developing countries, the percentage of EVs used is very low compared to petrol or diesel vehicles. Still, most of the countries are lagging behind in building the necessary infrastructure for EV charging. The objective of this paper is formulated as an integer linear programming (ILP) to identify the optimal EV charging station distance and wait time. A dashboard/mobile software application has been developed in this paper to reduce the overall time a user would need to charge their electric vehicle. The Branch and Cut Algorithm (BCA) is effectively applied in this software to select the optimal charging station in terms of reduced travel and charging time. The software is concerned with the constraints like the EV's charge status, the locations of the nearest charging stations, the number of cars waiting in line at the charging stations, and the EV model.

Due to the busy schedule most of the people do not have a time to separate their waste. However, there is a significant issue with the segregation of the collected garbage. The implementation of an intelligent trash-management architecture is essential for the removal or reduction of waste and the maintenance of a clean, corporate environment. An IoT-stationed smart waste management device is proposed in this study that uses sensor devices to identify rubbish in the dustbins. With the aid of sensors, the waste substances in it will be separated through IoT as soon as it is discovered. Sensors and the IoT module are connected through a microcontroller. To detect the presence of garbage, an ultrasonic sensor is used. All garbage entered will be caught by the web camera and processed by the machine learning module once it has been processed. Using the model, we can identify the many forms of waste, such as paper, plastic, and glass, which account for most of the garbage materials found in a home area. This aids in removing the trash from the trash can in the most efficient and effective manner possible. This research presents an IoT, and Machine Learning based completely intelligent trash segregation and management System that recognizes the dustbins' wastes using sensor systems. This project aims to develop an automated waste segregation system using a CNN algorithm that will capture waste images from a camera with object detection and classify waste materials such as paper, plastic, and glass so that the waste can be recycled appropriately. The proposed architecture with CNN gives an accuracy of 84.67%.

In contrast, behavioural biometric-based Continuous Authentication (CA) focuses on continuously authenticating the user while using the device. Among behavioural biometrics, keystroke dynamics is an efficient and well-researched behavioural biometric. Keystrokes dynamics refers to the unique typing patterns of the user. However, despite many frameworks proposed for mobile CA using keystroke dynamics, they are only evaluated for their discriminative power using traditional metrics such as Equal Error Rate. However, these evaluations are unable to capture temporal performance. Hence, in this work, we evaluate the state-of-the-art keystroke dynamics systems using continuous evaluation metrics. Our analysis indicates that these systems perform differently with traditional and continuous evaluation metrics, stressing the importance of evaluating CA systems using traditional and continuous evaluation metrics for a holistic assessment.

Although there have been multiple studies pertaining to MOOCs and learner feedback around the world, there is a limited number of research in obtaining learner perspective in Sri Lanka. This research aims to determine the driving factors for enrolling in MOOCs, reasons to drop out, and the preference between online and traditional in-class courses in Sri Lankan context. A survey concerning the above criteria was distributed among 245 Sri Lankan MOOC learners, and the responses were analysed to obtain the results of this study. In this survey, the driving factors for the learners to enrol in MOOCs have been classified under three main categories; cognitive, career, and other. Further, the MOOC learners were questioned to explore the reasons for dropping out of those courses and the general opinion on the online and in-class courses was also obtained. The results from the study suggested that the factors for the learners to enrol in courses include a combination of cognitive, career and other factors, and a considerable amount of participants in the survey had dropped out of MOOCs, while the preference for the in-class courses was much higher than the online courses. Therefore, it can be concluded that to provide quality and effective education to MOOC learners, their preferences and suggestions must be highly concerned.","","979-8-3503-4737-1","10.1109/ICARC57651.2023.10145628","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10145628","drop out;education;e-learning;learner perception;MOOCs","Surveys;Computer aided instruction;Electronic learning;Engineering profession;Education;Portals;Certification","","","","27","IEEE","12 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Online education has gained popularity due to its ability to provide more flexible access to information and teaching at any time and from any location. Students and faculty members can connect to their institution’s online portals and engage in virtual educational activities through the use of live environments provided by electronic learning management systems. Despite the fact that modern technology actively facilitates these online sessions, students’ active involvement remains a difficulty that has been addressed in prior studies. Using the Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER) model, the sentiment of roughly 220,000 tweets was calculated to identify people’s opinions toward online learning by using sentiments as positive, negative, and neutral. The topic modeling was utilized to uncover some hidden themes and to define the narrative and direction of the online learning related topics. Topic modeling also helped to detect inter-cluster similar terms and assess the flow of information from a group of similar perspectives. In this study, one text feature extraction TF-IDF with LDA model was utilized for topic modeling and an optimum number of topics were extracted from the corpus that are mostly addressed in the tweets. Finally, a cutting-edge deep learning and machine learning classification model was applied to the dataset with varying epoch sizes to predict and classify the emotions of the participants and proposed a new machine learning approach to evaluate the dataset related to online learning. Multiple parameters, such as accuracy, validation loss, validation accuracy, etc., have been used to evaluate the deep learning model.","","979-8-3503-4737-1","10.1109/ICARC57651.2023.10145609","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10145609","sentiment analysis;topic modeling;e-Learning;online learning;distance learning;twitter","Deep learning;Analytical models;Sentiment analysis;Social networking (online);Pandemics;Education;Predictive models","","3","","16","IEEE","12 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, green supply chain management has become a buzzword in the emerging supply chain environment due to its concept of saving the environment while providing a highly competitive advantage to the organisation. Nevertheless, because of the complexities of the processes, implementing green supply chain management practices have lots of risks associated with it. Risks is an uncertainty that can disrupt normal operations by causing considerable losses to the organisations. Therefore, it is evident that managing risks in implementing green supply chain practices is crucial to gain the maximum outcome. Since then, some previous studies have been conducted to identify and analyse the risks and categories. This paper reviewed existing studies from 2007 to 2022 under green supply chain management and risks analysis on green supply chain management. The present study was conducted through a systematic literature review and presented various risk categories and specific risks in each of the categories and also to identify the multiple approaches that researchers had used for the analysis. This study brings up the importance of further analysing the risks in the green supply chain using a case study since the significant risks for the industry differ from industry to industry.","","979-8-3503-4737-1","10.1109/ICARC57651.2023.10145646","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10145646","Green Practices;Green Supply Chain;Green Supply Chain Management;Risk Analysis","Industries;Supply chain management;Systematics;Uncertainty;Databases;Bibliographies;Green products","","","","23","IEEE","12 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Social considerations may somewhat alleviate this unpredictability. In the context of ICOs, this study examines the impact of social media, notably Twitter and discussion forums, on organizational legitimacy, financing, market success, expert rating, and success rate. Most of the studies employ OLS regression and Sentimental analysis on tweets about ICO investments, Twitter followers, underpricing, and Twitter threads. The findings of this paper imply that high participation on ICO Twitter accounts leads to an increased search volume about ICO, and emotional language used under Twitter accounts. The results are suitable for entrepreneurs and prospective ICO investors. Moreover, participation in discussion forums lends legitimacy to organizations. This paper recommends further investigation into how the ICO phenomenon emerged as a fundamentally IT-based fundraising technique.

Therefore, novel mechanisms to predict traffic accidents and issue timely warnings are of great interest to academia and industry. So far, the computational and communication infrastructures were not able to provide fast enough services to implement real-time traffic collision avoidance and warning systems in a collaborative manner. Most of the conventional systems are inbuilt into vehicles and operate with the limited information acquired from their own sensors. However, the latest edge computing technologies when paired with ultra-reliable low-latency communications in 5G/6G networks can provide suitable computational power and latency levels for effective collision avoidance mechanisms in a collaborative setting. In that regard, this paper presents a vehicular edge computing architecture that collects the positional and dynamic information of vehicles of a given area and predicts possible collisions well in advance. The system is capable of sending warning signals to vehicles in danger using the low latency 5G/6G links and avoiding possible collisions. The simulation results prove that the 5G/6G links are capable of supporting less than 10 ms latency for vehicular edge computing even with a high number of vehicles in the area. Further, the collision prediction algorithm is tested with real-life data sets and it demonstrates high accuracy in predicting imminent traffic collisions.","","979-8-3503-4737-1","10.1109/ICARC57651.2023.10145607","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10145607","Vehicular Edge Computing;Collision Avoidance;5G/6G;URLLC","Simulation;Collaboration;Ultra reliable low latency communication;Real-time systems;Sensors;Collision avoidance;Vehicle dynamics","","3","","18","IEEE","12 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a model that works on a mobile application based on a Convolutional Neural Network using a pre-trained model to identify currency notes in real time from a smartphone camera. Crucial factors in constructing this model are speed, accuracy, and size. A self-collected dataset of 14,000 Sri Lankan currency note images in numerous conditions was used for primary model training. Data augmentation, transfer learning through VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet, MobileNet, NASNet, and EfficientNet pre-trained models using bottleneck features and fine-tuning on top of bottleneck features are the main methods used in this model. This model reached above 98% in terms of testing accuracy using DenseNet121 with fine-tuning by testing 315 partially occulted, rotated Sri Lankan currency notes in different daylight conditions and cluttered backgrounds. The proposed model can recognize the currency note using TensorFlow Lite when it is pointed at the camera. The present research is limited to daylight image capturing to ensure the better performance of the model. The findings of this research would help visually impaired people to recognize Sri Lankan currency notes precisely and with less effort through the simple installation of a smartphone.","","979-8-3503-4737-1","10.1109/ICARC57651.2023.10145672","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10145672","Visually Impaired;Convolutional Neural Network;Sri Lankan Currency Notes;Transfer Learning","Training;Performance evaluation;Computational modeling;Transfer learning;Predictive models;Cameras;Data models","","","","20","IEEE","12 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
