To address this, the paper proposes using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques like GradCAM, GradCAM++, and LRP to improve the transparency and interpretability of a cervical cell classification model, making it a novel contribution to enhancing the trustworthiness of automated cervical cancer detection. Using the Herlev Dataset, we employ data pre-processing, data augmentation techniques and develop a binary classification model, achieving a 91.94% accuracy with VGG16. The qualitative analysis of XAI methods confirmed that the model relied on nucleus and cytoplasm features, key indicators of malignancy.

Accurate pathology identification during the brain MRI analysis procedure is crucial as misdiagnoses or missed findings can greatly affect a patient's treatment and long-term prediction. With the recent advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the medical field, researchers have approached various techniques to detect brain diseases using AI. Although AI models exhibit high accuracy, they suffer from a lack of transparency and interpretability, paving the way for the development of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods in brain disease diagnosis. Image segmentation, machine learning, deep learning and XAI are important for assisting the diagnostic procedure. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of various existing techniques in brain disease detection using MRI is presented, starting with image segmentation techniques, followed by classification techniques, and finally, XAI techniques.

A healthy lifestyle can greatly enhance one's ability to achieve one's goals and aspirations sustainably. Unfortunately, many individuals in the modern era tend to overlook the importance of this attribute, missing out on a tremendous investment in their overall well-being. Thus, mental, and physical health, as well as related attributes, play a pivotal role in determining the value of our lives. Therefore, everyone should have the opportunity to evaluate their lifestyle status. After knowing the status of their own lifestyle they can rearrange their life in a positive direction. As a solution to this issue, the study's main objective is to predict the current status of the lifestyle using deep learning algorithms. In the context of assessing lifestyle, the analysis involves a rich dataset comprising 22 distinct features drawn from an extensive dataset of over 15,000 data points. After pre-processing, to tackle the inherent complexity and variability of this dataset, our research employed deep learning models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and SVM (Support Vector Machine). After taking the individual algorithm results, to further enhance the accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure while reducing error rates, these models were ingeniously combined in an ensemble approach. Leveraging the weighted average method, this ensemble model surpassed the individual models, yielding superior results that could achieve 94.51% accuracy. Moreover, this ensemble strategy contributed significantly to mitigating overfitting and bias, making it a robust and reliable tool for lifestyle assessment.","","979-8-3503-8486-4","10.1109/ICARC61713.2024.10499747","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10499747","Healthy Lifestyle;Machine Learning;Ensemble approach;Weighted average;Prediction","Support vector machines;Deep learning;Training;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Convolutional neural networks","","","","15","IEEE","22 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A bug is an error or defect in a computer program that prevents it from functioning as intended. Bug prioritization is the process of determining which bugs should be fixed first. Prioritizing bugs is essential because it helps teams focus their efforts on fixing the most critical issues first. In recent years, the majority of researchers have focused their efforts on software bug priority-level prediction since currently it has been done manually. It is a time-consuming work and the accuracy level is also low. Therefore, the primary goal of this study is to propose an approach for predicting the bug priority level using deep learning algorithms. We used the Bugzilla dataset, which included more than 25,000 bug reports. After preprocessing data, we used several feature extraction methods, such as Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe), Word to Vector (Word2Vec), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and Document to Vector (Doc2Vec) methods to extract the features. There are four convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, including AlexNet, 1DCNN, ResNet, and DenseNet used to compare the best architecture for predicting the bug priority. The accuracy is provided by each separate model: AlexNet 88.62%, 1DCNN 77.81%, ResNet 76.33%, and DenseNet 96.69%. This evaluation result discovered that DenseNet outperformed other CNN architectures in accuracy, precision, f-measure, recall, and error values. Using a proposed model, a new bug can be found and can easily assign a priority level to it while reducing the job of the software developers.","","979-8-3503-8486-4","10.1109/ICARC61713.2024.10499704","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10499704","Priority prediction;Bug report;Deep learning CNN architectures","Deep learning;Computer bugs;Software algorithms;Computer architecture;Software quality;Predictive models;Feature extraction","","","","15","IEEE","22 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current treatments lack customization, prompting the need for a support system that aids psychiatrists in selecting appropriate treatment types or combinations for their patients. This research addresses the absence of tailored treatments by considering various parameters such as symptoms, user availability, preferences, and patient history. With a significant number of individuals in Sri Lanka who have social phobia, awareness of available treatments remains low. The proposed framework aims to bridge this gap by identifying the most effective treatment type for each patient based on their unique parameters. The research involves data collection from social phobia patients to discern the most suitable treatment types. The findings will contribute to the development of a model capable of identifying optimal therapies based on individual severity of symptoms and other relevant parameters. To assess the accuracy of the developed model confusion matrix will be employed and using metrices like micro and macro averaging for precision and recall, accuracy will be measured. Validation will be performed using both the trained model, a new dataset and manual annotator. Demonstrating higher accuracy in the validation process will affirm the model's efficacy, indicating it as a superior solution to address current shortcomings.

Presently, Sri Lanka is in a challenging economic environment due to the unforeseen depreciation of the Sri Lankan Rupee (LKR). This study investigates the viability of employing artificial neural networks with several optimization algorithms in the prediction of exchange rates. The data were sourced from the Yahoo finance database, spanning from January 1st, 2008, to February 28th, 2022. The investigation used historical lagged data with moving average technical indicators as the inputs for Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) models. This study applied neural networks of FFNN with optimization algorithms of adaptive moment estimation (ADAM), stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and root mean square propagation (RMSprop), Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) with SGD and RMSprop optimization algorithms, GRNN, and LSTM model implementing ADAM and RMSprop optimization algorithms in forecasting exchange rates involving major currencies of AUD, CAD, CHF, EURO, GBP, JPY, SGD and USD against LKR. The assessment of the predictive capacity of each fitted model was conducted by evaluating error metrics of mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). The empirical findings demonstrated that the FFNNs, TDNNs and LSTM models exhibited superior performance in predicting exchange rates compared to GRNNs. Specifically, the FFNN with the RMSprop algorithm demonstrated lower error values for AUD/LKR, CHF/LKR, EURO/LKR, and JPY/LKR. Additionally, for GBP/LKR, the FFNN with the ADAM algorithm performed well, while the TDNN with RMSprop showed superior performance for CAD/LKR. Furthermore, the LSTM with ADAM algorithm proved to be most effective for predicting SGD/LKR and for USD/LKR it was LSTM with RMSprop algorithm.","","979-8-3503-8486-4","10.1109/ICARC61713.2024.10499767","University of Peradeniya(grant numbers:NRPL/2023/03/S); University of Kelaniya(grant numbers:RP/03/02/08/01/2021); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10499767","exchange rate;neural networks;optimization algorithms;lagged data;moving average","Exchange rates;Solid modeling;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Forecasting","","1","","11","IEEE","22 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This effort proposes a machine learning approach guided by expert insights to identify the team player potential of IT professionals. This study introduces a systematic taxonomy for team formation to effectuate this, identifying the most paramount factors that gauge team player dynamics. This approach signifies the extent of the team player role in individuals grounded on real-world inputs. This endeavour develops an automated framework based on experts' criteria in response to the nuanced understanding of human traits. The five most influential traits were identified through a comprehensive review of the experiences of experts in the field and relevant studies focused on team building. In building this framework through machine learning, three algorithms were mainly explored they are Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network algorithms, where The Random Forest algorithm, which showcases the best performance and accuracy, was selected.

This paper explores a novel approach that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) and Deterministic, Independent-of-Corpus Embeddings (DICE) for customer segmentation. LLMs are used to generate sentence embeddings for textual features, while DICE is used to generate numeracy preserving word embeddings for numerical features. The embeddings are then combined and clustered using k-means.

The critical period for a child's growth and development is 1 to 60 months. The early identification of a child's malnutrition status is a strong foundation for lifelong health and well-being. Therefore, the objective here is to develop a model for early detection, and prediction of malnutrition in children. This study draws on a sample of 574 children under the age of five years in the Lunugala area, who were chosen randomly to be involved in the development of a predictive model for malnutrition using ensemble learning techniques. After pre-processing the collected sample, the dataset was partitioned into 70% of training set and 30% of testing set. Nine Machine Learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Guassian Na√Øve Bayes (GNB), Bernoulli Na√Øve Bayes (BNB), Complement Na√Øve Bayes (CNB), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were initially used. And the evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure were utilized to access the performance of these individual algorithms. After comparing the nine base learners with each other based on accuracy, the three best performing Machine Learning algorithms were combined and integrated into an ensemble model using techniques such as Soft Voting Classifier, Hard Voting Classifier and Stacking Classifier. The evaluation of these ensemble models, also based on accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure revealed that the Stacking Classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 93%. Consequently, the study concludes that the ensemble learning technique is well-suited for better prediction of malnutrition status.","","979-8-3503-8486-4","10.1109/ICARC61713.2024.10499742","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10499742","Machine Learning;Ensemble Learning;Prediction Model;Evaluation Metrics","Support vector machines;Measurement;Training;Pediatrics;Machine learning algorithms;Stacking;Predictive models","","","","24","IEEE","22 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This concern has recently gained attention in Sri Lanka, sparking discussions on the current and future trajectory of food commodity prices. The increase in agricultural commodity prices is partially attributed to the rising costs of petroleum. This study aims to understand the relationship between coconut prices and fluctuations in the price of Lanka Petrol (LP92), as well as the connection between coconut prices and changes in the price of Lanka Auto Diesel (LAD). It also investigates variations in Samba prices concerning LP92 price changes, given their significance as highly consumed food products and widely used petroleum commodities. Utilizing data from January 2008 to November 2022 sourced from the official website of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the study employs Vector Auto Regressive (VAR) models. Model selection is determined by criteria such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Schwarz-Bayesian Information Criterion (SC), and Hannan-Quinn (HQ). The study finds that VAR (2) is optimal for identifying Samba price variations with LP92, VAR (3) for Coconut price variations with LAD, and VAR (3) for Coconut price variations with LP92. The dataset is split into an 80% training set and a 20% test set for model evaluation, utilizing metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Further investigations into the impact of fuel costs on Samba and Coconut prices, using Granger causality and cointegration tests with LAD and LP92 price data, yield no conclusive evidence of causation. The study proceeds to remodel the original datasets using machine learning techniques, with the models demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional VAR models. Based on all the models, the models created through machine learning techniques showed superior performances showing 27%, 30%, 19% MAPE values and 11.12, 14.7, 16.6 MAE values for respective three FFNN models.

Traditional methods such as radio-collaring and physical marking are often cumbersome, time-consuming, and intrusive. To address this challenge, a novel approach involving a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and image processing techniques has been employed in this research to individually identify leopards based on their distinctive black spot patterns. The research relies on a dataset consisting of high-resolution photographs of leopards taken in diverse locations, specifically chosen to encompass a range of individuals with unique spot patterns. Image processing algorithms, including Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), were used to extract and analyze the black spot patterns on the leopards' coats. The YOLO Algorithm, integrated into the CNN, was employed to accurately segment and isolate the leopards within input images. The research has resulted in the development of a software system that offers a user-friendly web interface for uploading leopard images and conducting individual identification analyses. Field researchers and enthusiasts can submit photographs of leopards they encounter, and the system cross-references these images with an existing database to determine each leopard's identity. Impressively, the system consistently achieves an accuracy rate of approximately 92% in correctly identifying individual leopards based on their black spot patterns. The newly developed software system provides an effective, non-intrusive, and automated tool for enhancing wildlife management and conservation endeavors. This technology streamlines the process of monitoring and tracking leopards, enabling a deeper understanding of their behavior, geographic range, and population dynamics.

The primary objective of this research is to develop an advanced and practical solution to restore motion-blurred images with high accuracy and speed, enabling improved decision-making and analysis in critical domains. The motion deblurring model makes use of an autoencoder architecture, which includes an encoder and a decoder. The encoder reduces spatial dimensions gradually, forming a condensed representation in latent space. To generate deblurred images, the decoder, its mirror counterpart, upsamples the latent space using transposed convolutional layers.

The most difficult challenge is to match the basic sounds, ‚Äúphonemes‚Äù with the lip movement called ‚Äúvisemes‚Äù. This study has been used static viseme approach by deriving twenty three (23) Sinhala viseme classes and a deep learning model has been developed to map visemes with Sinhala letters. In system implementation, text input is provided first, after which the system produces audio and the deep learning model generates a collection of visemes based on the given text. The system interface then offers three options for playing the visemes at various speeds, including fast, normal, and slow. The user interface was created in Python, and the deep learning model is integrated into the system. This model will be very helpful to use in cartoon industry to build Sinhala speaking cartoon characters and also be used to train deaf people to read lips.","","979-8-3503-8486-4","10.1109/ICARC61713.2024.10499753","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10499753","lip synchronization;Sinhala;Static visemes;multi-class classification","Deep learning;Industries;Lips;Computational modeling;Buildings;Mouth;User interfaces","","","","21","IEEE","22 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to the limited availability of resources, linguistic support for these languages is limited, making them low-resource languages. To address this resource deficit, this study proposes the development of a rule-based transliteration tool that can annotate Sinhala words into Romanized Sinhala, accommodating the diverse ad hoc typing patterns used by the community. The research approach involved a comprehensive survey employing a stratified sampling method, considering variables such as age, gender, and language proficiency. 215 participants were presented with an online survey comprising 12 Sinhala sentences to capture various transliteration patterns related to Sinhala characters which are necessary for the annotation process. Analysis of the survey responses led to the formulation of 92 general rules and 26 special rules, encapsulating ad-hoc Romanized Sinhala typing patterns. Using these rules, Sinhala dictionaries were annotated, building a large corpus of data which consists of Sinhala and its Romanized Sinhala patterns. The annotated dataset was validated using a back transliteration tool, achieving an 84%-word accuracy rate.

People can send messages, upload and view videos, and share their opinions and comments with others using these platforms. Among these platforms, YouTube is one of the best for sharing videos, especially cooking recipe videos. With the increasing popularity of these videos, sentiment analysis of user comments has become an important research area in the field of natural language processing (NLP). In the case of YouTube cooking recipe videos, sentiment analysis can provide valuable insights into how viewers perceive and respond to the videos and the recipes presented in them. Because when a user searches for a specific recipe, many videos will appear, and among those videos, some might be relevant and others might be irrelevant. Even though it has comments, reading comments and filtering relevant information remain difficult chores due to the vast amount of text. This research aims to develop a real-time system to provide recipe recommendations and classify comments into positive, neutral, and negative ways to facilitate the users' choice of the best and expected cooking recipe videos among those appearing on YouTube without spending too much time. Also content creators will benefit from the sentiment analysis results, which will provide them with insightful criticism on their cooking recipe videos that will help them better understand user preferences and improve their content. In this paper, the study propose a novel approach for Sentiment Analysis on Tanglish (Tamil and English) comments extracted from various Tamil YouTube channels using the YouTube API. The sentiments were classified using custom-built lexicon-based techniques, which include a comprehensive list of Tanglish words for cooking recipes. This approach addresses a research gap in sentiment analysis for non-standard languages, enabling accurate sentiment classification for cooking recipe videos.","","979-8-3503-8486-4","10.1109/ICARC61713.2024.10499736","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10499736","sentiment analysis;tanglish;natural language processing;lexicon;cooking recipe","Sentiment analysis;Video on demand;Negative feedback;Social networking (online);Noise;Real-time systems;User experience","","","","12","IEEE","22 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Swa Bhasha 2.0: Addressing Ambiguities in Romanized Sinhala to Native Sinhala Transliteration Using Neural Machine Translation","S. Dharmasiri; T. G. D. K.

In Sinhala, both Romanized and native Sinhala are widely used. Due to the informal textual abbreviation known as ‚ÄúSinglish‚Äù however, attempts to translate Romanized Sinhala into native Sinhala via machine transliteration may result in errors. Rule-based transliteration systems may not be compatible with the ad hoc transliterations used in Singlish. To translate Romanized Sinhala back precisely and consistently into Native Sinhala, a novel NMT approach has been proposed. To address the complexities of casual Romanized Sinhala, a hybrid strategy combining rule-based and neural machine translation has been proposed. This strategy aims to eliminate word selection ambiguity by selecting the best word suggestions from a pool of predicted words using a suggestion algorithm. Combining the advantages of Suggestion algorithms and neural machine translation, the proposed transliterator has the potential to considerably enhance reverse transliteration and improve communication in native Sinhala by combining the strengths of both approaches. After completing the GRU model, the performance of the machine translation models on the BLEU test improved to 0.8, indicating high word-level translation accuracy. Significant potential exists for the proposed transliterator to enhance reverse transliteration and improve communication in Sinhala. While preliminary test results are promising, additional testing and refinement are required to improve the overall efficacy of machine translation models.","","979-8-3503-8486-4","10.1109/ICARC61713.2024.10499785","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10499785","Machine transliteration;Neural machine translation;Reverse transliteration;Sinhala","Training;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Data collection;Prediction algorithms;Data models;Complexity theory","","","","18","IEEE","22 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result of this, the adoption of virtual learning accelerated in an unprecedented manner in the education sector. Inevitable transformation provides lots of challenges and opportunities for teachers and learners. Reducing face-to-face interaction and peer interaction demands high self-regulation in learning. Time and resource management play a wide role in virtual learning. Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) allows learners to complete courses with high grades. This study investigates SRL among non-STEM students using a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). This study utilizes Humanities and Social Science students from the Faculty of Arts and Culture with Information Communication Technology specializing from the state university. The study shows that the number of interactions with VLE does not impact academic performance. Further, this study confirmed that the students have more interest in learning in the starting days of the module and it is reducing with time. Unfortunately even as the final exam approaches interest in the module is reduced. Further, students are more interested to learn in the weekdays than during the weekend. Students habitually access the VLE during the lecture to check the updates. Most of the students are taking the ‚Äúpath of growth‚Äù rather than selecting the ‚Äúwell-being path‚Äù to pass the exams in the online environment. In addition, these findings can serve as a roadmap for academics to design their course modules.","","979-8-3503-8486-4","10.1109/ICARC61713.2024.10499778","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10499778","Self - Regulated Learning;SRL;Virtual Learning Environment (VLE);non-STEM;post-Covid-19","COVID-19;Electronic learning;Art;Digital transformation;Force;Social sciences;Communications technology","","","","36","IEEE","22 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the adoption of HIS has been lower in Sri Lanka compared to developed countries. This study aims to investigate the factors influencing the adoption of HIS among public healthcare staff in Sri Lanka using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). A survey was conducted among 100 doctors and nurses and the data was analyzed using the Partial Least Squares Structured Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) with bootstrapping of 5000 subsamples. The results show that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude and behavioral intention have significant positive relationships. However, perceived ease of use did not have a significant positive relationship with attitude. These findings suggest that the TAM provides a useful framework for understanding the adoption of HIS in Sri Lanka. This study provides insights into the adoption of technology for healthcare stakeholders in Sri Lanka and allows practitioners to identify the factors that need to be considered when successfully deploying HIS.","","979-8-3503-8486-4","10.1109/ICARC61713.2024.10499764","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10499764","Technology Acceptance Model;Health Information Systems;Electronic Health Records;Partial Least Squares Structured Equation Modelling","Surveys;Productivity;Technology acceptance model;Hospitals;Computational modeling;Mathematical models;Data models","","","","16","IEEE","22 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The apparel industry in Sri Lanka faces significant challenges in optimizing inventory write-off costs, which occur when surplus items are disposed of due to inaccurate forecasting, changes in the product order and product quantity, and misjudgment of order categories. The main reason for these concerns is the difficulty in identifying real-time customers' behaviour, which is crucial in demand forecasting. Our study includes an analysis of the effects of write-offs across diverse industries, alongside an exploration of the determinants influencing these write-off processes. A vital challenge encompassed within the apparel field is the rapid variations of demand for future orders. This paper provides a detailed analysis of studies addressing the identification of demand variations, the impact of inventory optimization on write-offs, and methodologies aimed at enhancing this optimization process. The primary objective of this investigation is to identify the existing research gap through a comprehensive examination of prior literature on the write-off procedures. Our study evaluates the write-off optimization through demand forecasting and inventory optimization. We outline the factors affecting write-off processes in different industries to interpret how demand forecasting contributes to inventory optimization. Through a scholarly approach, we provide recommendations for the apparel industry on strategizing the inventory write-off process. By strategically implementing write-offs, the company can minimize financial losses, reduce inventory costs, and streamline operational workflows, positioning itself as a market leader while demonstrating a commitment to sustainability.","","979-8-3503-8486-4","10.1109/ICARC61713.2024.10499743","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10499743","demand forecasting;inventory optimization;inventory write-off;predictive analytics;social data analytics","Industries;Costs;Supply chain management;Social networking (online);Time series analysis;Demand forecasting;Market research","","","","23","IEEE","22 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is encouraging the companies to adopt green marketing strategies. This research examines the impact of these strategies on consumer purchasing decisions to buy green products and investigates the moderating effects of favorable government policies and social media. By conducting a systematic review of 52 papers from different contexts from various geographical and cultural backgrounds in previous research, the important factors such as eco labelling, environmental ads, eco brand, green pricing, and products are identified as positively impacting consumer purchasing decisions to buy green products. Social media and favorable government policies moderate the relationship between green marketing strategies and consumer purchasing decisions. But the challenges are contextual diversity and economic downturns in Sri Lanka. Recommendations for food and beverage companies include incorporating green marketing strategies in production, engaging with social media, aligning with government laws. Furthermore, understanding the impacts of different green marketing strategies specific to the industry is necessary. As response to economic challenges, adjusting and localization strategies are suggested. This research provides useful insights for the companies in the food and beverage industry to deal with growing needs for environmentally friendly products. Also, this research contributes to the existing theory by adding more knowledge and solving the contradictions about the positive impact of identified green marketing strategies and adding new view about moderating effect of favorable government policies and social media which is the novelty of this study.","","979-8-3503-8486-4","10.1109/ICARC61713.2024.10499777","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10499777","Green marketing strategies;Consumer purchasing decisions;Eco label;green advertisement;Eco brand","Government policies;Economics;Systematics;Social networking (online);Reviews;Green products;Companies","","","","52","IEEE","22 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This shift towards teleworking has influenced the landscape of internships also. While some aspects of teaching and learning have smoothly transitioned into online environments, Others face several challenges. Identifying the specific strategies, skills, and practices required for effective online learning, especially in the context of an online internship course, remains a less defined domain specially in Sri Lanka. The pandemic-induced transition to remote work and education has been a global phenomenon, yet its impact on internships remains relatively unexplored. Moreover, the existing literature on new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and teleworking is frequently outdated due to the rapidly changing technological landscape. This systematic literature review tries to identify the impact of this shift towards teleworking on university internship programs in Sri Lanka. Internships are essential for an undergraduate to find future career opportunities. Also, to strengthen their self-confidence and self-satisfaction in the lifelong learning process. When considering the major drawbacks, there's a big gap in communication between interns and their supervisors, harder to establish and maintain work relationships when interns can't be physically present or meet their supervisors face-to-face. There are identified positive sides also. Big companies and smaller ones alike can benefit from virtual internships. They're good for both students and employers because they're flexible, cost-effective, and easy to access. Plus, virtual internships can be especially helpful for differently abled students. This benefits both the employer and the student. Also mentoring is identified as a key factor for the success of virtual internships.","","979-8-3503-8486-4","10.1109/ICARC61713.2024.10499773","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10499773","Teleworking;Remote Work;Work from Home;University Internship Programs;COVID-19 Pandemic;Virtual Internships;E-internships","COVID-19;Systematics;Reviews;Pandemics;Education;Remote working;Information and communication technology","","","","20","IEEE","22 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This issue becomes particularly urgent in industrial scenarios where various sources of gases and chemicals are present. Especially, with the advent of Industry 5.0, factories, industrial plants, and other industrial environments are becoming highly dynamic and pose challenges in monitoring the indoor air quality. Hence, the traditional deployment of fixed air quality monitoring sensors would not be effective in industry 5.0 scenarios. In light of these challenges, this paper presents a novel air quality monitoring system integrated with edge computing. The edge computer manages the layout of the industrial space and has the over-all understanding of the current operational settings. The air quality monitoring units will connect with the edge computer via a WLAN network, enabling the edge computer to build a real-time, digital representation of the factory. Moreover, the paper proposes a localization algorithm to precisely identify air pollution incidents such as gas leakages using the air quality monitoring units. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture, combined with the localization algorithm, can accurately pinpoint sources of air pollution.","","979-8-3503-8486-4","10.1109/ICARC61713.2024.10499769","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10499769","Air Quality Monitoring;Edge Computing;Industry 5.0","Location awareness;Computational modeling;Atmospheric modeling;Heuristic algorithms;Layout;Air quality;Air pollution","","","","14","IEEE","22 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
