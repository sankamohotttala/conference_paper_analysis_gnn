For teacher transfers based on government policy, the education ministry only considers factors such as the vacancies, subject the teacher teaches and the district of the transferred school. But according to several research studies it has been proven that the performance of an employee depends on human factors such as gender, organizational culture etc. Therefore, a question arises on job satisfaction of the teachers when they are transferred based on government policy. By conducting a survey, information on job satisfaction and other human factors which impact on satisfaction of teachers was gathered. With the analysis of the collected data using classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree classifier, Random Forest classifier and Gradient Boost classifier this study attempts to identify whether a teacher will be satisfied with a new placement prior to being transferred. Result prove that Decision Tree classifier provides a better model with higher accuracy compared to other models in identifying job satisfaction of an employee with a new work place.","","978-1-6654-0741-0","10.1109/ICARC54489.2022.9754089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9754089","Human factors;Machine Learning;School System;Teacher Transfer;Job Satisfaction","Government policies;Computational modeling;Human factors;Intelligent systems;Regression tree analysis;Random forests;Logistics","","","","17","IEEE","14 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Soil condition and the fertilizer management in agricultural fields has been a challenge due to the lack of cost effective soil nutrient sensing methods that can rapidly give the results. We have produced an inexpensive and portable IoT-based soil nutrient analyzer that estimates the level of soil nutrient contents using colorimetry and machine learning. The proposed device estimates the nutrient content by initially detecting the color of a microfluidic cassette which contains chemical reagents and the soil sample. The use of microfluidic cassettes drastically reduces the required amount of chemical reagents, thereby brings down the cost of a test. This color readings that are determined by the nutrient concentrations present in the soil sample are fed into a supervised machine learning model based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), that runs on a mobile app which predicts the nutrient concentrations of the soil sample. The GPR model also provides the variance of the estimates. In this paper, we present the nutrient sensing IoT device and the nutrient prediction model based on the Gaussian process regression. We validate our device and the prediction model with experimental data where we achieve 93% accuracy in predicting the soil nutrient concentration level (Low, Medium, High).","","978-1-6654-0741-0","10.1109/ICARC54489.2022.9754105","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9754105","Soil nutrient analysis;fertilizer recommendation;smart agriculture;edge AI","Training;Image color analysis;Gaussian processes;Machine learning;Soil;Predictive models;Sensors","","2","","11","IEEE","14 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The need for additional testing methods has increased due to the limitations in current testing methods. This study focused on applying deep learning methods to classify chest X-rays as COVID-19 pneumonia, normal, and non-COVID pneumonia. We developed two deep learning models to ascertain COVID-19 using Posteroanterior (PA) and Anteroposterior (AP) view Chest X-rays. Two datasets of 300 chest X-rays for PA and AP views were used. As the first deep learning model, a new Convolutional Neural Network from scratch was built. Then, VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 transfer learning models were used. Finally, the transfer learning models were extended by adding more layers to the top of the existing model. As the first part of this study, we used PA view X-rays and obtained 98% overall accuracy, and 98% precision, 99% recall, and 99% f1-score for the COVID-19 class. In the second part, we used AP view X-rays and obtained 79% overall accuracy, and 96% precision, 83% recall, and 89% f1-score for the COVID-19 class. Finally, gradient-based class activation maps were generated using the proposed extended VGG19 model to visualize the areas that helped the model in detecting COVID-19. This research showed that high performance could be obtained in detecting COVID-19 using extended transfer learning models. In PA view X-rays, the proposed extended VGG-19 model performed the best, and in AP view X-rays, the proposed extended ResNet50 model performed the best.","","978-1-6654-0741-0","10.1109/ICARC54489.2022.9753784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9753784","Covid-19;Chest X-ray;Machine Learning;Deep Learning;Transfer Learning","COVID-19;Deep learning;Biological system modeling;Pulmonary diseases;Computational modeling;Transfer learning;X-rays","","2","","22","IEEE","14 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study presents an approach to classify the Near-Earth Asteroid Population as potentially hazardous or non-hazardous by allowing deep neural networks to learn complex representations that exist in the distribution of available asteroid orbital data.

The purpose of this study is the prosodic transfer of the target speech with a small amount of available data by fine-tuning the base model between the same languages. We investigate how much prosodic information was transferred. As prosodic information, we focus on the speaker’s voice quality, and dialect. We evaluate dialect from ""pronunciation"" in the English TTS model and ""intonation"" in the Japanese TTS model. At present, it was possible to transfer the voice quality of same-sex speakers from a small amount of voices for about 15 minutes.

Experimental results of existing works provide sufficient evident to our argument. Motivated by another line of research, we introduce a representation learning algorithm that produce rich representations for social users who are involved in fake news dissemination.

Furthermore, the Real sense camera is used for object boundary detection to produce more accurate data for the navigation algorithm. Once all the data proceed, data will return to the robot, where the navigation algorithm will start execution in parallel with a recovery behavior algorithm and scan algorithm.

The complexity of the programming of the robots is now reduced by using middleware like Robot Operating System (ROS). However, the communication and control of the heterogeneous service robots using very high-level instruction is still tricky because of differences in ROS topics. If a user has issued a high-level instruction to all multiple heterogeneous robots in the same environment, then all robots must complete the given task without considering the software differences in each robot. This research has developed a web-based interface where users can input high-level instruction to all multiple heterogeneous robots running in the same environment. We have used three levels of instructions. Level 01 moves robot forward for the given speed for some distance without obstacles. Level 02 is to move the robot to a specific location without obstacles. Level 03 is to navigate the robot to a goal with some obstacles in the environment. Initially, all robots need to register their software specifications and hardware specification Format (URDF) in the robot registration engine with the help of the ontology. Then all service robots act according to the instruction given by the interpreter.

Although there are rules and regulations to safeguard the community, the necessity to reduce the exposure of such hate posts in the user’s timeline in every possible way is encouraged. Facebook users communicate through three behaviors: reactions, comments, and shares where those have an individual psychological inference towards the social emotion of a post as a significant proportion of natural behaviours of the user are deemed to be manifested by what is posted and how they have reacted to them. Thus, this proposed model identifies the social media behavioural factors which positively support hate and non-hate posts using the Binary Logistic Regression Statistical Model in a multilingual context. The experiment shows that social media behavioural factors such as ""angry"", ""haha"", ""sad"", and the number of shares positively support hate posts and can be applied as a parameter to reduce the engagement of hate posts as well to use them for detecting hate content which is a challenging task even the state-of-the-art models struggle with. Experimentally, this study shows that incorporating social media behavioural factors significantly improves classification performance by obtaining 88% accuracy when compared to similar methods.

In the proposed solution, there are two main modules: Vehicle module and Road Infrastructure Broadcast (RIB) module. A wireless ad-hoc mesh network was used to automatically configure the network with available nodes to maximize the availability. Proposed solution will assist drivers with three main warning types. Assisting driver on important infrastructure details and vehicles ahead, assisting with vehicle speed warnings, and assisting with overtake possibility which is calculated through a fuzzy logic algorithm. Fuzzy algorithm will use distance, speed, and vehicle angle as the membership functions to calculate the overtake possibility. By providing accurate warnings with identified scenarios, proposed solution would be able to help drivers to navigate in unknown areas with confident and more focus.

The study used Twitter as the social media platform to discover the emotional perspective of Sri Lankans during the outbreak. The emotion analysis was conducted based on 8-scale emotions (anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust) provided by the NRC Emotion Lexicon. The extraction of noteworthy topics propagated in different domains of COVID-19 helps to identify the perception of society during the pandemic. Latent Dirichlet Allocation was applied to explore relevant and accurate topics. Furthermore, the wordcloud was generated by representing the most insightful data points which help to keep track of social concerns or viewpoints. Our experiment shows that people discuss under three major themes of ""COVID-19 Immunization"", ""Government rules and regulations to prevent the spread of COVID-19"" and ""COVID-19 related health statistics"". Furthermore, the ""fear"" is dominated among eight emotions followed by ""anticipation"" and ""sadness"" when Sri Lankans express their thoughts and feelings related to COVID-19.

The BERT natural language model is used to compensate for the TF-IDF framework’s shortcomings in interpreting a document’s underlying semantic meaning. As a result, the developed model encodes the questional ranges and true semantics of a report. Scalability is key in today’s growing data size and is taken into consideration as part of the study.

Advancements in deep learning in the recent past and the availability of high computational power have been influencing the automation of diagnosing brain tumors. DenseNet and U-Net are considered state of the art deep learning models for classification and segmentation of MRIs respectively. Despite the progress of deep learning in diagnosing using medical images, generic convolutional neural networks are still not fully adopted in clinical settings as they lack robustness and reliability. Moreover, such black-box models don’t offer a human interpretable justification as to why certain classification decisions are made, which makes them less preferable for medical diagnostics. Brain tumor segmentation and classification using deep learning techniques has been a popular research area in the last few decades but still, there are only a few models that are interpretable. In this paper, we have proposed an interpretable deep learning model which is more human understandable than existing black-box models, designed based on U-Net and DenseNet to segment and classify brain tumors using MRI.

In Sri Lanka, the standard visual language is Sri Lankan Sign Language (SSL). Even though SSL is mainly based on British Sign Language (BSL), there are numerous unique signs in the SSL dictionary, as visual languages are evolved on what a person sees and how well he/she can express their ideas in the form of facial expressions and body movements. In SSL, there are signs with multiple meanings and also combined signs which express a piece of particular information that does not have a dedicated sign. Due to the significance of such signs, interpretation of SSL into meaningful text has become a research challenge. At the same time, hand gestures play a major part in expressing information in visual languages. Hence, identifying hand gestures through vision-based or sensor-based approaches is very important in sign language interpretation. However, vision-based approaches are susceptible to conditions such as background color, light variations, etc., and also demand more computing power. Moreover, the sensor-based solutions are better in gesture recognition. In this paper, we, therefore, present a sensor-based combined approach using Leap Motion technology with geometric template matching and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify and interpret unique signs, signs with multiple meanings, and combined signs in SSL into Sinhala text. The proposed approach shows very promising results for the interpretation of both static and dynamic signs of SSL.","","978-1-6654-0741-0","10.1109/ICARC54489.2022.9754050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9754050","Visual language;Leap Motion;Sign language;Geometric template matching","Visualization;Dictionaries;Gears;Face recognition;Dynamics;Gesture recognition;Artificial neural networks","","5","","31","IEEE","14 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Though there are numerous state and private actors in Sri Lanka's handicraft ecosystem, a fundamental issue that has led to this predicament is a lack of communication and collaboration among these organizations and stakeholders. More specifically, a lack of communication and collaboration among ecosystem actors impairs the ecosystem's resource flow, resulting in inefficiencies in crucial industry processes. To overcome current inefficiencies and make the craft ecosystem more productive and sustainable, digitalization has been recognized as a major option. This research was carried out with the goal of identifying inefficiencies in the Sri Lankan handicraft industry's supply chain and developing a resource flow model that could be used as the foundation during the process of digitalization of industry processes. Following a thorough study of the literature, data was gathered through interviews and surveys with key stakeholders. These unique data were analyzed to identify interconnections and resource flows, and a model reflecting the handicraft supply chain's information, knowledge, financial, products, and material resource transactions was developed with relevant validation procedures. This resource flow model might serve as the cornerstone for future digital transformation, allowing all actors in the handicraft ecosystem to connect digitally and eliminate inefficiencies through improved communication and collaboration.","","978-1-6654-0741-0","10.1109/ICARC54489.2022.9753935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9753935","Digitalization;Handicraft industry;Crafts ecosystem;Resource flow model","Industries;Fault diagnosis;Analytical models;Social networking (online);Pandemics;Digital transformation;Ecosystems","","","","12","IEEE","14 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These policies could be introduced by the respective universities or by a higher governing body such as the University Grants Commission (UGC). This research was conducted with the expectation of evaluating two policies prepared by the UGC Standing Committee on Computing and introduced through the Commission Circular No.: 02/2013. These two policies, namely policy on passwords and policy on computing resources, have been prepared to regularise the passwords used by the university staff members and govern the use of computing resources in universities. The main objective of this research was to see to what extent the universities have implemented these policies, which were introduced in 2013. The study was conducted among staff members representing all national universities in Sri Lanka. The research consisted of two parts. The first stage evaluated the knowledge of university staff members and IT staff members regarding the above two policies. An online questionnaire was distributed among 5150 university academic and non-academic staff members of all local universities. Eight hundred fifty responses were received for this questionnaire which was beyond the expected sample size. The second questionnaire was sent to each university’s IT directors and other IT officers in a similar capacity. These surveys revealed that many staff members were not aware of these policies. 53.53% of staff members mentioned that they were unsure whether their own university had an IT policy. As the second stage of this research, the policy on passwords was cross-referenced with NIST 2020 guidelines for passwords to see how well the UGC policies are on par with the new guidelines. This revealed that the UGC policy on passwords needs to be updated according to the evolved techniques. The research makes some recommendations to improve the effectiveness of these policies, such as conducting periodic reviews and awareness sessions, carrying out surveys to check how well the university employees have understood and adhered to the guidelines, incorporating these policies into the university’s own IT policies, etc.","","978-1-6654-0741-0","10.1109/ICARC54489.2022.9753817","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9753817","policy;UGC;passwords;computing resources;university","Information security;Passwords;NIST;Developing countries;Guidelines","","","","17","IEEE","14 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Routing data in FANETs is difficult due to the inherent properties of the network and the environmental characteristics, and a routing protocol that considers all these properties is really needed. In this work, we consider popular routing protocols from the field of ad-hoc networking and a few recently proposed routing protocols for FANETs, and carry out simulation based experiments to measure their performance in a simulated FANET environment. Based on their measured performance, we identify the applicability issues of these protocols in FANETs.We propose hn-AODV, an improved routing protocol for FANETs, which considers the two important properties namely the number of neighbors and the hop count along the identified paths. During the path finding process of hn-AODV, if the sequence number of Route Request or Route Reply message is greater than the sequence number of the stored route request or route reply message maintained in a node, then hn-AODV will operate similar to the well-known ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing protocol. In the case where the sequence numbers are found to be equal, hn-AODV considers the hop count and the number of neighboring nodes along the path to resolve the tie. Our simulation based experiments show that the proposed hn-AODV shows a better performance when compared to other well-known protocols. Our proposed algorithm also yields the lowest end-to-end delay than the well-known protocols.","","978-1-6654-0741-0","10.1109/ICARC54489.2022.9753801","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9753801","FANETs;UAVs;Routing Protocols;Mobility Models;MANETs;hn-AODV","Computational modeling;Routing;Routing protocols;Ad hoc networks;Delays","","4","","17","IEEE","14 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Until now there are no effective drugs or vaccines available against SARS-CoV-2. In this regard, medicinal plants captured enormous attention, as natural products are safe and easily available bioactive compounds in which maintain the disease homeostasis. Amongst, natural compounds of Coriandrum sativum L (coriander) have proved to be effective in viral infection, as they possess antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities. However, molecular regulation of such bioactivities remains elusive. We performed molecular docking analyses using AutoDock Vina to investigate the potential inhibitory activities of the seven natural compounds of coriander (limonene, geraniol, gamma-terpinene, geranyl acetate, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid) against the essential proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (main protease (Mpro), nonstructural protein-13 (NSP-13), Papaine like protease (PLpro) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase(RdRp)) together with two main inflammatory proteins ( cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and interleukin-6 (IL- 6)). The empirical and knowledge-based algorithm of AutoDock Vina was utilized to calculate free binding energies of ligands and BIOVIA discovery studio 2020 tool was used to visualize docking results. Our results reveal that gallic acid has a strong binding affinity to Mpro (-5.8 kcal/mol) and NSP13 (-7.0 kcal/mol) forming five and three conventional hydrogen bonds respectively. Further, caffeic acid demonstrates a higher binding affinity to PLpro (-7.4 kcal/mol) and RdRp (-6.7 kcal/mol) while securing four and three conventional hydrogen bonds respectively. Interestingly, both COX-2 (-6.9 kcal/mol) and IL-6 (-6.3 kcal/mol) also show a higher binding affinity to gallic acids. In addition, gallic acid stabilizes three conventional hydrogen bonds with COX-2 whereas it forms four conventional hydrogen bonds with IL-6. Further, drug-likeness properties of gallic acid and caffeic acid were determined using the SWISSADME server. Our results show that both gallic acid and caffeic do not violate Lipinski rules suggesting these compounds as new antiviral and anti-inflammatory drug candidates for SARS-CoV-2.","","978-1-6654-0741-0","10.1109/ICARC54489.2022.9753740","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9753740","Viral Protein;Docking;CoV-2","Proteins;Drugs;Visualization;RNA;Hydrogen;Regulation;Coronaviruses;COVID-19","","1","","39","IEEE","14 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is one of the techniques in which 50 GHz fixed grid spacing is used to assign multiple traffics on a single fiber link for the optimal usage of the frequency spectrum. Further, elastic optical network (EON) is a promising solution where the frequency spectrum can even be effectively utilized with 12.5 GHz flexible spacing to accommodate higher number of network traffic. Protection method of a fiber link in survivability is an essential requirement in optical communication, because of a failure on a primary link causes huge amount of data loss. If the primary path is protected by a backup link, the traffic can be rerouted through the backup path without any loss. Since, pre-configured backup protection with sharing (PBPS) and shared protection methods are involved in the backup resource sharing, we consider these two protection methods in our study. Unlike shared protection, network nodes can be pre-configured in PBPS method at the connection establishment phase. Further, wavelength conversion is a technique which does not follow wavelength continuity constraint and utilize the frequency spectrum effectively. Therefore, blocking probability of new connections can be reduced. In this paper, we investigate wavelength conversion scheme with backup resource sharing particularly in EON.

However, existing solutions have limitations concerning distributed and simultaneous resource management for AI computation and data processing at the edge; concurrent and real-time application execution; and platform-independent deployment. Hence, first, we propose a novel three-layer architecture that facilitates the above service requirements. Then we have developed a novel platform and relevant modules with integrated AI processing and edge computer paradigms considering issues related to scalability, heterogeneity, security, and interoperability of IoT services.

As patents are territorial and data management for patent applications is primarily handled by local intellectual property offices, the patent authentication and management procedure are inefficient and time-consuming on a worldwide scale. Furthermore, data management concerns in the patent process frequently result in conflicts and legal actions among competing parties. Blockchain technology is generally recognized for its potential application in the development of decentralized, secured, and transparent systems with immutable records. As a result, it appears to be a viable solution for overcoming issues in the patent domain. The purpose of this research is to demonstrate how blockchain technology may help with patent authentication and management. To explore the process of the existing system and its shortcomings, interviews with relevant stakeholders and a comprehensive literature review are conducted. To overcome the highlighted barriers and limitations, a novel architecture and prototype of a consortium blockchain system are proposed, with regulated bodies as nodes such as the World Intellectual Property Office and Regional IP Offices handling the consensus mechanism. The proposed consortium blockchain design is based on the Ethereum architecture and is equipped with smart contracts. To arrive at conclusions, it is tested in a simulated environment with generated actors and data. The present study demonstrates that blockchain can ensure the reliability of patent data and real-time updating of records efficiently and at a low cost. Furthermore, patents that have been registered to this network become reliable across IP offices. Without relying on a single patent office, patent applications can be approved or rejected with the proposed architecture. The prototype model shows considerable improvement in establishing evidence of first ownership which helps minimize a significant number of litigations. The study further shows how Blockchain Serves as a distributed database which is very much useful in cross-validated reliable systems like secure document management for government processes.","","978-1-6654-0741-0","10.1109/ICARC54489.2022.9754086","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9754086","Blockchain Technology;Consortium Blockchain;Patent authentication and management;Smart contracts;Ethereum","Patents;Smart contracts;Authentication;Prototypes;Intellectual property;Computer architecture;Real-time systems","","","","14","IEEE","14 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In Sri Lanka, the Z- score is being used for evaluating advanced level students’ performance based on their subject wise results. It is further used to rank students district wise and island wide. As number of students are increasing in each year for advanced level examination, computation of z-score needs more computing resources. Computation of Z-score on a large dataset is a resource-intensive task. To solve this computation process, it is essential to address parallelising operations to speed up the computation and sustain less total processing power when it is distributed to tiny processing nodes. The present research study investigates and experiments the feasibility of parallelizing the z-score computation using existing computing resources connected through the local network as clusters, without affecting the existing infrastructure.

As a result, a superior CPU scheduling algorithm leads to higher OS performance while using limited resources and for shorter periods of time. As a result, several strategies have been suggested and implemented to improve CPU scheduling performance. Any scheduler’s primary responsibility is to assign jobs to the most effective and reliable resource available. It’s also a fact that if jobs and resources aren’t planned properly, the entire operating system’s productivity suffers significantly. The ""Round Robin"" is deemed an effective and fair approach because of each process is allocated the same amount of time quantum. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the system is determined by the selected time-quantum. The major goal of this research is to develop the present round-robin algorithm by enhancing the time quantum for candidate processes in real-time in such a way that its impartiality is maintained. There is no loss of property. This paper’s proposed algorithm finds the time left in a process’s last turn, and then Determines whether it is time-based on a certain threshold value, should quantum be expanded or not. An arithmetic simulation has been created to demonstrate that the suggested method is correct. It outperforms the traditional round-robin algorithm. In words of several performing metrics such as average waiting time, context switches and the number of turnaround times, the suggested adjusted version of the round- robin algorithm outperforms the traditional round-robin algorithm, according to the results of the experimental investigation.","","978-1-6654-0741-0","10.1109/ICARC54489.2022.9754037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9754037","CPU Scheduling;Round-Robin Algorithm;Time quantum;Turnaround time;Waiting time;Response Time;Context Switching","Productivity;Schedules;Quantum computing;Switches;Scheduling;Real-time systems;Time factors","","4","","28","IEEE","14 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

During maintenance and reuse, reading through the full source code will be quite tough. Many programmers stick to reading and navigating code than they develop it. Most experienced developers reuse existing code functionality. The cost of searching for and integrating reusable code determines the success of source code reuse. One method for identifying source code functionality names is to use a topic model. While numerous studies have focused on using topic models to analyze software systems, none have retrieved topics from actual source code syntax. By considering the optimal number of conditional statements, expressions, arrays, Boolean operators, and other unique programming keywords utilized is critical for any source code functionality name prediction. The dataset for the research model was collected from a variety of software developers' source code throughout the world. In software development, there are many different types of source code repositories, including source code algorithms. These repositories will be unstructured and unusable, requiring a technique to transform them into something useable. The source code data will be decomposed into smaller bits of programming language phrases using the Java parser library. Boosting algorithms are still more advantageous under the regime of limited training data and low knowledge for parameter modification. This study looked at supervised learning boosting algorithms such as XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, and AdaBoost.

Students and scholars need a variety of formal and informal documents for their education purpose but, a large amount of data make it difficult to filter useful information from the internet. Therefore, these documents need labels for students and scholars who are engage in education to use the documents efficiently. As a result, document classification helps to assign a label to formal and informal documents. Text classification according to formal and informal styles is challenging for obtaining good accuracy, as linguistics differences are rich. This article proposed a document classification method based on formal and informal styles. This experiment used 200 text documents that were collected from the web targeting main two categories formal documents and informal documents. After preprocessing the text documents extract the feature vectors using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer, and they are converted into numerical representation for adoption to the training model. The classification used Decision Tree (J48), Random Forest, Multilayer Perception (MLP), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) and it is tested with 5 folds cross-validation. Based on the experiment results of four classification algorithms, it indicates that the proposed approach using a Random Forest algorithm can classify the data with 94.97% accuracy with height precision, recall, f-measure values, and lowest error when comparing with the other algorithms.","","978-1-6654-0741-0","10.1109/ICARC54489.2022.9753774","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9753774","document classification;formal writing style;informal writing style;machine learning algorithm","Support vector machines;Training;Machine learning algorithms;Writing;Linguistics;Frequency conversion;Feature extraction","","","","15","IEEE","14 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
