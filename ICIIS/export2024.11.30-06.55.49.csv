The method is unconventional but versatile and can be used with a variety of low-to-medium gain antennas. The use of the method for a compact RCA validates its compatibility with low-gain antennas. The far-field results predicted by numerical simulations indicate that the antenna system can scan a beam having a peak directivity of 15 dBi into a conical region having an apex angle of 70°, without dropping peak directivity more than 3dB from the maximum value. This compact beam-steering antenna system is cheaper than active antenna arrays and convenient to operate than mechanically steered reflectors. The maximum height of the system is 1.3λ0, which means that the antenna can be fixed inside a cylindrical cavity and its beam direction can be remotely controlled. Due to the low-cost and elegant design of the front-end antenna, a wireless backhaul mesh network can be established, which can be dynamically adjusted to improve quality of service.","2164-7011","978-1-7281-3706-3","10.1109/ICIIS47346.2019.9063288","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9063288","beam steering;beam scanning;compact antenna;metasurfaces;phase transformation;near-field;transmit arrays","Phased arrays;Azimuth;Reflector antennas;Apertures;Directive antennas","","2","","17","IEEE","13 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed design is further improved by tweaking with computer simulations. Moreover, the verified design is realized with low-cost PCB manufacturing techniques. The assembled SICL ring resonator was measured and tested with a Vector Network Analyser. The effects due to the transition from the coaxial line (the connector) to the feeder line were removed from the measurement by de-embedding.

This method outputs a named entity dataset containing classification of Wikidata entities to the three main entity classes (Person, Location and Organization), which are widely used in Natural Language Processing. This provides classification of over 12 million Wikidata entities to the three main entity classes. The results are compared to previous work in the field.

It plays a vital role in growth of a company. Among those companies, telecommunication industry is a prominent industry where upselling is highly influenced on churn reduction and stabilizing the customer base. As this increases the satisfaction of customers through adding products and services it is very effective in a marketing perspective. In a typical 4G LTE package marketing, customer will be offered to select a fixed package out of a set of pre-defined packages. The decision of selecting a suitable package by customer will be mainly an instinct driven decision due to lack of previous experience of using an LTE package. This will result in selecting an unsuitable package, which will lead to over usage of data. As a result, it will cause customer dissatisfaction and loss of potential income for the company. Therefore, it is essential for a telecommunication company to identify the customers who have the potential to upgrade their packages based on customer usage. In this research, potential package upgrades are predicted for LTE broadband users through a supervised learning method using different classification models. One of the key factors on obtaining a high accuracy model for classifying customers is to address the class imbalance problem that is present in the telecommunication data. The ratio between potential package upgrades and normal customers is highly skewed towards normal customers. This is addressed using SMOTE which is an oversampling method that creates synthetic samples using existing data points. Potential customers identified by a classification model trained by a dataset consist of usage behavior. The prediction results will be published to a dashboard that can be consumed by decision makers.","2164-7011","978-1-7281-3706-3","10.1109/ICIIS47346.2019.9063278","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9063278","telecommunication;machine learning;class imbalance;upselling","","","1","","10","IEEE","13 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The non-invasive assessment of hemoglobin concentration in arterial blood using pulse oximetry is mainly based on the light absorption by hemoglobin in the blood and the analysis of resulting photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. PPG wave is analyzed by using the modulation ratio which contains the ratios of AC and DC components from red and IR wavelength light. In this study, the relationship between hemoglobin concentrations measured using invasive technique and the modulation ratio and the age of the subject was analyzed using 84 subjects.

The whippletree mechanism plays an important role in force distribution to actuate all the fingers individually. To address the comfort issue, a cover made of flexible material covered with silicon adhesive was used at contact points. After fabricating and assembling the designed prosthesis, the performance of the design was analyzed by conducting several tests.

Feature extraction of HSIs involves the extraction of informative and non-redundant information which can later be input to advance learning algorithms for various purposes including classification, clustering and unmixing. Many feature extraction techniques fail to extract discriminative information of classes with minute differences in HSIs due to similar spectral signatures and similar major variance directions of the pixels belonging to those classes. In most techniques, the minor variance directions of the dataset are ignored since they do not convey useful information in terms of feature extraction. However, these minor variance directions prove to be a convenient base in terms of distinguishing between classes with minute differences in HSIs. The proposed mechanism exploits these minor variance directions with the implication of correlation between the spectral bands of two individual classes and constructs a framework which then utilizes the underlying spatial connectivity of classes to classify pixels.

An algorithmic approach is taken based on three hypotheses; random superimposing, background replacement and color augmentation. These techniques are based on; color identification, background replacement, random selection, pixel superimposing, color blending and image color augmenting. The algorithms are researched, implemented, experimented in-depth and critically compared. Four algorithms are implemented, two based on randomly superimposing and one each based on background replacement and color augmentation. Background replacement algorithm was hardly able to complete the task effectively, thus is the lowest ranked algorithm. In contrast, randomly superimposing and color augmenting algorithms were capable of carrying out the task successfully. Randomly superimposing costed the least time to complete, but the generated images were unnatural whereas color augmenting produced a perfectly natural image though the color of the final output was inaccurate.

However, in most of the practical multi-way relay systems, the channels between the nodes and the relay are heterogeneous. In particular, some channels can be of relatively poorer quality than the other channels which require a higher error protection. Meanwhile, providing the same high level of error protection in high-quality channels results in a poor spectral efficiency. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel unequal error protection scheme in order to achieve a better trade-off between the error performance and spectral efficiency. In the proposed scheme, low-quality channels are provided higher protection using a full-length low density parity check (LDPC) channel code, while high-quality channels are given lower protection using punctured LDPC codes. We also develop a novel joint LDPC decoding and network coding algorithm to be employed at the relay. As demonstrated by the simulation results, the proposed error protection scheme together with the joint decoding algorithm provides an excellent spectral efficiency-error performance trade-off in practical multi-way wireless relay systems.","2164-7011","978-1-7281-3706-3","10.1109/ICIIS47346.2019.9063289","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9063289","Multi-way relay channel;unequal error protection;Joint channel-physical layer network coding","Relays;Decoding;Iterative decoding;Wireless communication;Spectral efficiency;Network coding","","","","15","IEEE","13 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These systems allow transportation providers to track and monitor their goods in real-time and geo-fencing. Most of the ITS frameworks use internet of things (IoT) technology for theft detection and real-time monitoring. This paper presents a new solution named Smart Protector to monitor the status of a sealed package in real-time that can be easily integrated into an existing IoT-based ITS framework. The Smart Protector mechanism is a unique and reliable enhancement for the packages. This system contains three main components, namely, Smart Seal, ESP8266 - 01 microcontroller, and a GPS module. In case of any tampering attempt, the system will notify the relevant parties via email and SMS by obtaining real-time data from the smart seal. This may improve the efficiency of transportation and security. The smart protector is capable of connecting to the nearest Wi-Fi source which can be easily configured. When designing such a device, using a single-board computer is inefficient and impractical due to its high-power consumption. The proposed smart protector uses an ESP8266 - 01 module which has a standby power consumption <; 1.0mW and an operating voltage of 3.0V ~3.6V in the standard mode. Deep sleep mode configured in ESP8266 - 01 can be powered up for more than three months using a LiPo battery which has 800 mAh capacity. The device is capable of transferring multi-formatted data through different types of IoT integration protocols such as MQTT, HTTP, Kafka and a few others. Our experimental results show that the proposed system has successfully identified multiple tampering attempts and notified at the same time without having any conflicts or delay. We tested the smart seal with different packaging types and successfully identified the tampering attempts. Moreover, this device will be beneficial to commercial users and the public in general. Finally, this study comes out with recommendations to the researchers to explore low-cost solutions other than expensive satellite communication for message passing during transportation.","2164-7011","978-1-7281-3706-3","10.1109/ICIIS47346.2019.9063319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9063319","IOT;Transportation;Smart Protector;Smart Seal;Wireless","Microcontrollers;Real-time systems;Transportation;Wires;Intelligent sensors;Monitoring","","4","","10","IEEE","13 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The reason for overcrowding is the failure of effective management of patient queues. Unnecessary queue waits not only boost patient frustration with their disease but also waste precious time of the patient. It may not always be a better solution to solve this problem by increasing the number of employees. Because the increasing number of employees may be costly than the total waiting cost of patients. The current mean waiting time is analyzed by using queuing theory. Two fundamental parameters of queuing theory analysis are arrival rate ($\lambda$) and service rate ($\mu$) and they were used to analyze not only current mean waiting time but also to predict mean waiting times by the increasing number of servers. Finally, a new system has been proposed to reduce mean waiting times in outpatient department (OPD). The arrival times and service times of each patient for each service point (registration, consultation and pharmacy) were gathered straight over a week. The tea breaks and lunchtimes were not considered while calculating service rates. The present queue system adapts Tandem queuing theory and the queue discipline is first come first serve discipline. The analytical results show that the mean waiting times of OPD system can be reduced in a considerable amount from the proposed system. Further, this rate is achieved through theoretical analysis and a simulated patient management system is suggested as the administration can be used to decrease waiting times in queues.","2164-7011","978-1-7281-3706-3","10.1109/ICIIS47346.2019.9063348","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9063348","Queuing theory;Patients management system;Tandem queues","Queueing analysis;Hospitals;Servers;Mathematical model;Information systems;Drugs","","4","","13","IEEE","13 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Transient originated from capacitor bank switching is one of the main reason which affects the power quality. If capacitor banks are not properly selected and placed in the power system they could amplify and propagate harmonics, deteriorate the power quality to an unacceptable levels. On the other hand those transients negatively affected on the various equipment such as switchgears. Therefore analysis of capacitor bank performance under harmonic conditions is an essential step when designing capacitor banks. In this paper, one of the key grid substation in Sri Lankan power system; Thulhiriya is considered as a case study. A 10 MVAR shunt capacitors is already in operation at Thulhiriya GSS (Grid Sub Station). A 15 MVAR new capacitor bank is planned to be added at the neighbouring Kegalle GSS. The selected substation was modelled using Power Factory DIgSILENT simulation software to analyse the transients and harmonics. Different operating scenarios were studied, and the results were compared with the normal operation of Thulhiriya GSS. As the simulation results depicts addition of Kegalle GSS has increased number of parallel and series resonant frequencies. In principle, this situation can be generalize for substations having similar load profiles. Therefore when planning capacitor banks for a substations nearby existing capacitor banks, it is very important to do a detail investigation in order to identify possible resonance conditions. Such resonance conditions needs to be rectify by upgrades to the existing capacitor bank and such upgrades can be part of the new capacitor bank project.","2164-7011","978-1-7281-3706-3","10.1109/ICIIS47346.2019.9063262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9063262","Power Quality;Harmonic Resonance;Harmonic Distortion;Resonant Frequency","","","2","","12","IEEE","13 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed approach is based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), more specifically on a double deep Q-network (DDQN) made of a convolutional neural network (CNN). The wideband spectrum is divided into a number of sub-bands and each sub-band consists of a number of channels. The problem is modeled as a multi-task DRL, where each sub-band represents a single task. Transfer learning is used between tasks to speed up the learning process. It is shown, through simulations, that the proposed technique can efficiently learn an effective strategy to avoid harmful signals in a noncontiguous wideband spectrum.

To meet this challenge, different techniques are been introduced. In this paper, basic NOMA model with two users is extended for multiple users to achieve higher capacity. We implement NOMA with three and four UE's, where superposition coding is introduced at the transmitter side and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) at the receiving end.

Opportunistic networking uses locally available wireless technologies such as Bluetooth for pair-wise data forwarding hoping that the data will ultimately reach the destination. Intermittent connectivity and long delays in data delivery are inherent properties of this kind of opportunistic networking. The existence of communities among larger groups of people presents us with a use case for opportunistic networking where the content of interest could be shared opportunistically among the members of communities. In such communities, members are not just attached to a single community but are usually connected to several communities based on their interests. Forwarding and routing algorithms that route content of interest among these communities should focus on the interests of the members of communities and other inherent properties of opportunistic networking. Therefore a more efficient routing algorithm that can work well with the inherent properties in such a community set up is needed. In this work we propose, design and develop a community-based routing algorithm, named SWift routing algorithm (SW algorithm), that can be used to route messages among the community members in an opportunistic manner.

Due to the availability of a vast amount of documents on the Internet, plagiarism has become a severe problem in this digital world. Hence the need for an automatic plagiarism detection tool is inevitable. There is a right amount of existing research on automated plagiarism detection, and there are several language-dependent and language-independent plagiarism detection tools available. The lack of adequate research for Sinhala plagiarism detection and the inefficiency of plagiarism detection tools for Sinhala text motivated this research which focuses on developing a Deep learning approach for plagiarism detection in Sinhala documents. In natural language processing (NLP), Word embedding has become a popular language modelling and feature learning technique. A word embedding model is capable of representing a word or a phrase as a vector of real numbers known as a word vector. A word vector represents the semantic and syntactic similarity of a word or phrase with other words in a corpus. Further, a sentence can be represented as a vector of values using the word vectors for words in that sentence. This research work proposes a method for Sinhala plagiarism detection by representing sentences as a vector of values and comparing the sentences based on these vector of values. For plagiarised sentences, the similarity of the vector of values would be high. A word embedding model is built using a Deep learning neural network and a Sinhala text corpus as part of this study. The word2vec algorithm and the publicly available UCSC_Sinhala_News corpus are used for this purpose. In the proposed model, a simple aggregation method is used to represent a sentence as a vector of values from the word vectors for words in that sentence. The cosine similarity and soft-cosine similarity metrics are used to quantify the similarity of sentences represented as a vector of values. The sentence pairs with the similarity scores higher than a threshold value are considered as plagiarised. The proposed model was implemented and tested on a newly created data set and found to be capable of detecting plagiarism with an accuracy of 97%. The model is found to be detecting direct and sophisticated copying such as replacing words with synonyms or changing the order of words in a sentence.","2164-7011","978-1-7281-3706-3","10.1109/ICIIS47346.2019.9063299","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9063299","Deep Learning;Word Vector;Plagiarism;Sinhala","Plagiarism;Natural language processing;Machine learning;Tools;Semantics;Measurement;Vocabulary","","3","","17","IEEE","13 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed data analytical approach differentiates itself from the other similar approaches that were focused only on the descriptive analysis rather than going for a bigger context with predictive modelling and formation pairs mining that would assist in modifying existing rules to tackle injury concerns. The predictive model that works with Kafka-stream processor real-time inputs and risky formation pairs identification by designing FP-Matrix, makes this far-reaching solution to analyse injury data on various grounds wherever applicable.","2164-7011","978-1-7281-3706-3","10.1109/ICIIS47346.2019.9063267","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9063267","NFL Plays;Concussions;Defense;Offense;Formation pairs;Predictive model;FP-Matrix","Injuries;Predictive models;Information technology;Games;Data models;Forestry","","","","22","IEEE","13 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A mood can be categorized as happy, sad, calm and angry. Most of the people today share their daily activities, opinions, feelings regularly in social media. Identification of current mood will be useful for recommendation systems to change or elevate moods. Thus, this proposed system identifies the current mood of a person by mining their social media contents such as posts, comments, image posts and emoticons. In the proposed solution, a score for the current mood is calculated in two stages; a score for text contents (images with text and posts/comments) and score for emoticons were computed. Posts made within a 24-hour period will be considered for the current mood and scores for multiple posts are combined using a temporal weighted average. Text classification is done using a 1D Convolution Neural Network and emoticon classification is performed using a survey.

This amazing ability has motivated the researchers worldwide to discover relationships between music and emotion. As a result, various data mining tasks have been carried out where state-of-the-art machine learning techniques are utilized in music emotion classification. However, the literature reveals that these studies frequently utilize western or western classical music whereas no considerable effort is reported in computational modeling of cultural-specific music e.g., Sri Lankan folk melodies, despite being an abundant source of emotion expression. Further, the applicability of existing classifiers trained using different ground-truth data, in other cultural-specific content is found to be problematic. Therefore, we applied machine learning techniques for emotion classification of a dataset which associates Sri Lankan folk melodies. Using MATLAB MIRToolbox, acoustic features pertaining to dynamics, rhythm, timbre, pitch, and tonality were extracted. Performance of five standard classification algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and k-Nearest Neighbor) were tested on the dataset comprising of 206 music stimuli (30s; 44100Hz; stereo; 32bit;. wav) representing happy, sad, and fear as the predominant emotions. Among the classifiers, k-NN yielded the highest accuracy value of 78.44%. Moreover, highly influential features were identified based on the correlations between the acoustic features and the class labels which resulted in an enhanced accuracy of 87.95% with k-NN. The findings of the study mark a promising initial step, introducing machine learning for emotion analysis of Sri Lankan folk melodies.","2164-7011","978-1-7281-3706-3","10.1109/ICIIS47346.2019.9063313","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9063313","Music emotion classification;Machine learning;Sri Lankan folk melodies","","","4","","28","IEEE","13 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are used to identity the two hydrodynamic key parameters; the added mass matrix and the damping matrix. Secondly, an adaptive controller is implemented to track the desired trajectory. This desired state-depend regressor matrix-based controller provides consistent result even under hydrodynamics parametric uncertainties.

Findings suggest that mindfulness enhances human wellbeing and helps people to develop a greater awareness of their body, mind, and emotions. The main objective of the research was to develop an application, an undergraduate could use to release their stress in tough situations using mindfulness practices. The conducted research project includes VR technologies, Reinforcement learning, Wearable Arduino components together with mindfulness-based stress reduction methods to support the features of the designed application. It may, therefore, provide a key to understanding one of the mechanisms that underlie the observed benefits of mindfulness approaches for mental health and wellbeing. Drawing on a sample of 25 questionnaire-based responses from the users, the generated results indicate the developed algorithm has an accuracy of 96.153%.

This paper develops preference based trust management method considering the additional operational conditions of the IoT objects. The proposed solution can compute the trustworthiness among SIoT members based on a pre-defined set of social relationships they have as well as their residual energy content.

Though there has been substantial progress related to protection of structures against lightning, research carried out during the past decades have led the lightning community to develop improved procedures for evaluating lightning exposure to structures. The location of vulnerable points struck by lightning and hence the placement of air terminals is obtained based on Rolling Sphere Method (RSM) whereby the striking distance is obtained as a function of stroke current. However, the model ignores dynamics of propagation of downward and upward leaders, geometry of the structure etc. This aspect becomes vital for smaller rolling sphere radii for tall structures with respect to several striking points.

Optimal DG placement in terms of sizing and location are crucial in minimizing the active power loss and maintaining stipulated network voltage levels. This paper presents a novel analytical method for optimal DG placement by defining a new sensitivity index referred to as Loss-Voltage Sensitivity Index (LVSI) combining traditional Voltage Sensitivity Index (VSI) and Loss Sensitivity Index (LSI). The best location for DG allocation evaluated by new index reflects the conditions for minimum power loss and voltage deviations in the network effectively as both VSI and LSI are utilized in the new formulation. The proposed method was verified using the IEEE-6 bus test system considering several operating scenarios. Results show that proposed methodology is accurate in determining the optimal sites for allocating DG units.","2164-7011","978-1-7281-3706-3","10.1109/ICIIS47346.2019.9063298","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9063298","Distributed generation;voltage sensitivity index (VSI);loss sensitivity index (LSI);loss minimization;voltage deviation;optimal location","Sensitivity;Large scale integration;Indexes;Jacobian matrices;Resource management;Load flow;Reactive power","","6","","15","IEEE","13 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
