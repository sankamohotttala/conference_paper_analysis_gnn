Dipole trimming has resulted in an improved impedance bandwidth while parasitic elements has led to a better gain performance in comparison to the conventional PLPDA. The proposed 12-element low profile PLPDA antenna exhibits high gain of 7.2 – 10.1 dB within the wide operational bandwidth, and a stable directional radiation pattern.

In addition, the same infrastructure used by the VLC system can be exploited to support optical wireless power transmission (OWPT). The Light-based IoT (LIoT) concept encompasses both wireless data and power transmission. Recently, the use of printed electronics (PE) technology has been considered as a highly attractive approach to implementing the LIoT concept, as PE will allow manufacturing energy-autonomous, low-cost and sustainable nodes that can be attached to virtually any object. In this paper, we study the problem of communication and power transfer purposes in the uplink direction. In particular, we carry out a feasibility study comparing the use of OLEDs and conventional LEDs for the mentioned tasks. The performance of actual state-of-the-art printed optical components are measured, evaluated, and contrasted with that of similar conventional (non-printed) components. We found that printed OLEDs, though exhibiting sub-optimal performance, offer a robust performance to be used as key components in the implementation of the LIoT concept.","2164-7011","978-1-6654-2637-4","10.1109/ICIIS53135.2021.9660680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660680","LIoT;VLC;OWPT;Printed electronics;OLED","Wireless communication;Performance evaluation;Organic light emitting diodes;Wireless power transmission;Internet of Things;Optical transmitters;Communication system security","","2","","18","EU","3 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A means to satisfy both these requirements is sharing resources among pre-configured backup connections. A specific switch architecture with components arranged in layers was used in the literature to achieve this. In this paper, we focus on this architecture. While we observe that the selection and arrangement of components in this architecture address important challenges, we find that the same arrangement of components leads to the following two issues. First, it provides alternative operating methods, route-through-layers and direct-routing approaches for adding primary connections at source nodes. We identify scenarios in which the route-through-layers approach is counterproductive in terms of resource sharing and therefore each approach can potentially have different impact on the overall performance. Second, the layering approach in the architecture limits the degree of resource sharing in certain scenarios. When this limitation is coupled with the constraint on the number of component layers available at network switches, it can also have significant impact on the overall performance. Our objectives are to quantitatively ascertain the significance of these two issues, and to find better means of operating networks at different scenarios. Our performance study verifies the following. (1) The route-through-layers approach is counterproductive and the direct-routing outperforms, as we found in specific scenarios, but only up to a certain traffic load. Beyond this traffic load, the route-through-layers approach outperforms. (2) When a network has switches with a small number of component layers, increasing the number of layers by a relatively small value yields significant gain in blocking performance. This outcome is important since it means, for instance, significant gain for relatively small upgrading cost, a welcome feature for network providers.","2164-7011","978-1-6654-2637-4","10.1109/ICIIS53135.2021.9660716","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660716","elastic optical networks;survivability;switches.","Integrated optics;Costs;Optical switches;Conferences;Telecommunication traffic;Optical fiber networks;Routing","","","","14","IEEE","3 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the key challenges in preprocessing these data is to deal with missing values. Since the measurements are recorded through sensors, missing values are ubiquitous in weather variables such as environmental temperature. Even though there are well-established methods to impute missing values in univariate time series data, the need of developing improved methods to impute large gaps persists. This paper compares the performances of ten existing methods in imputing missing values of hourly temperature data. Among the methods considered, Kalman smoothing on Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average model(ARIMA) and Kalman smoothing on structural time series model are the best methods in imputing missing values under MCAR (Missing Completely at Random) mechanism with exponentially distributed missing values. Moreover, this paper proposes a novel method to impute large gaps of hourly temperature data using regularized regression models on deseasonalized data. This method outperforms all the other considered methods in imputing large gaps.","2164-7011","978-1-6654-2637-4","10.1109/ICIIS53135.2021.9660672","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660672","Imputation;Missing at Random;Missing Completely at Random;Missing not at Random;Time Series;Weather","Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Temperature distribution;Interpolation;Smoothing methods;Time series analysis;Sensors","","","","18","IEEE","3 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The taste that is inherent in Sri Lankan spices is the main reason for this unique identification. The demand for Sri Lankan spices is growing day by day in local markets as well as in markets overseas. The plantation of spice crops needs to be planned carefully as those add a significant contribution not only to the domestic consumption but also to Sri Lanka’s export income. Hence, the cultivation of spices should be done systematically to provide a supply that meets the demand. In most cases, large scale and small scale of these crop plantations are not successful. Therefore, assisting these spice planters to identify the most suitable location for crop growth has become a critical requirement in the agriculture sector of Sri Lanka. As there are no applications developed yet in Sri Lanka to support this requirement, researchers try to give a reasonable solution to fill this gap. ‘Mr. Masala’ mobile application was developed with aim of encouraging planters to cultivate spices successfully. This mobile application can be used to identify whether a selected location by a planter is suitable to grow the spice plant they expect to grow. This is done by measuring environmental conditions such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, sunlight and soil pH. Also, users would be able to get an approximate amount of crop productivity, production costs & income for the size of their land, measure the amount of fertilizers needed for soil preparation & maintenance, and amount of pesticides needed to control pests and diseases. Furthermore, spice planters can measure factors required for the growth of spices regularly, helping them obtain expected yields and profits.","2164-7011","978-1-6654-2637-4","10.1109/ICIIS53135.2021.9660721","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660721","spice;pH value;cost estimation;crop yield;environmental conditions;disease identification;fertilizer","Temperature measurement;Productivity;Soil measurements;Crops;Soil;Maintenance engineering;Size measurement","","1","","9","IEEE","3 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But due to the high uncertainty of the game, it has become very difficult to come up with a stable and accurate model. The outcome model also depends on the number of overs, match type, time period, and player combination among many other factors. This research focuses only on the ODI matches that were played between ICC full members; Australia, West Indies, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Ireland, India, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, England, South Africa, and Pakistan. This outcome prediction is based on players’ performances in a team and some features specific to the team and the match. The individual performance of batsmen, bowlers, and fielders are analyzed separately considering all-time ODI data. The combined performance of batsmen and bowlers was analyzed, and compared with individual performances using statistical methods.

Most of the existing NILM techniques utilize one-dimensional (1D) time-series signal analysis to predict the individual appliance energy signals. The utilization of image-based methods for the disaggregation of energy signals is a relatively new approach in the NILM domain. This paper presents a study of a novel computer vision-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach when compared to the traditional time series-based NILM methods. Gramian Angular Fields (GAF) and Recurrence Plots (RP) have been widely used in recent literature to encode time series signals as images. Novel image classification techniques with the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) simplify the extraction of nuclear load features from encoded two-dimensional (2D) images. The results considered the indices validation accuracy and validation loss in comparing the performance of different vision-based AI approaches. The results reveal that Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF) outperforms both Gramian Angular Summation Field (GASF) and RP with a training accuracy of 97.9% and a validation accuracy of 94.2%. A comprehensive analysis and comparison are presented with an in-depth evaluation using multi-state appliances and it was concluded that GADF is the most suitable 1D to 2D conversion method for the representation of time series energy data for disaggregation purposes.","2164-7011","978-1-6654-2637-4","10.1109/ICIIS53135.2021.9660638","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660638","Disaggregation;NILM;Gramian Angular Field;Recurrence Plot;Time Series Signal","Training;Meters;Home appliances;Energy consumption;Time series analysis;Two dimensional displays;Feature extraction","","5","","20","IEEE","3 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But integrating large number of solar PV systems into the distribution network, can cause considerable effects on power flow stability and power quality. When more solar Photovoltaic is connected to a distribution grid, in day time, the solar penetration is high while the load is less. Then the terminal voltage tends to increase. This rise in voltage causes inverter tripping in the solar PV systems that affects the generation in the power system. Therefore, it requires a proper voltage control methodology at the distribution level. The voltage level can be maintained in between the desired standard levels by controlling reactive power injection. Though the power industry employs voltage controlling devices such as OLTCs and FACTS devises like SVC, STATCOM to maintain the grid voltage at the transmission level, they are not much used at the distribution level. Whenever the problem occurs, operator manually turn on the inverters. According to the details collected with reference to the distribution system in Northern Province Sri Lanka, a low voltage distribution system was modelled using PSCAD simulation, in order to overcome the stated problems. The aim of this model is to study the terminal voltage variation in the distribution grid with large number of solar PV connections and to restore the voltage levels again to the standard limits by applying different voltage control techniques. The study proposes two solutions, SVC and STATCOM to improve the performance of the power system. More economical and efficient method among two proposed solutions was validated using the simulation results. Net Present Value (NPV) method was used to provide proper economic analysis, related to the solution given, based on the simulation results.","2164-7011","978-1-6654-2637-4","10.1109/ICIIS53135.2021.9660646","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660646","Solar PV Integration;Voltage Rise;Distribution system","Performance evaluation;Simulation;System performance;Static VAr compensators;Power system stability;Automatic voltage control;Inverters","","1","","16","IEEE","3 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, poor voltage-control strategies at PV inverters, inevitably lower the yield from the PV system due to the discontinuity of PV connections along. In the proposed approach, a solution to the problem is presented that avoids discontinuities as much as possible, and it maximizes the yield through a voltage-coupled power-control strategy. The methodology is implemented and verified, based on a simulation study. The solution is offline type, and it uses a hybrid model of OpenDSS and MATLAB. With the aid of inputs such as load distribution, positions of the existing PV panels, and the ones to be connected, the line is modelled on OpenDSS and the optimum solution is obtained through MATLAB.

The maximum active power that can be delivered by a customer based on their distance along the feeder, while considering the installed/requested capacity of each customer were analyzed, for varying inverter power factors, to maximize the hosting capacity of a feeder.

However, the performance of the POS tagger with unknown words (words that do not appear in the lexicon) is not explored in the literature. The appearance of unknown words is a frequently occurring problem in POS tagging because, in real-world use, the NLP application will encounter words that are not in its lexicon.

This work presents a method to identify tomato plant diseases based on leaf images using transfer learning. We used a publicly available dataset which contains tomato plant leaf images for 10 different classes. We considered only five classes and data was split in ratio 8:1:1 for train, validation and test sets respectively. In this work, six different pre trained models were used with fine-tuning methods where we introduced some layers and removed some layers in the network architectures while enhancing the accuracy of models. Accuracies of all the models were above 97% except one model which got 95% accuracy on the testing. Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion matrix and Classification reports were used for evaluations and finally a novel convolutional neural network is proposed for plant disease classification focusing on a real environment. The mentioned model achieved an accuracy of 99.98% on training and an accuracy of 99% on testing. In this work, a good generalization performance could be achieved without data augmentation.

TSR plays an essential role in the intelligent transportation system (ITS). TSR can be utilised for driver assistance and, eventually, driverless vehicles to reduce accidents. Drivers usually concentrate on the road when driving; however, most traffic signs are located on the side of the road, leading to an accident. TSR enables users to observe traffic sign information without having to divert their attention away from the road. For the past four decades, TSR has been a hot topic of research. Because of the broad background, clutter, varying levels of illumination, variable sizes of traffic signs, and fluctuating weather conditions, TSR is an important but challenging procedure in ITS. Many efforts have been made to find answers to the major issues that they face. The objective of this study addresses the road traffic sign recognition using skipped convolutional layer architecture and neural network. This study differs from earlier studies in that it uses skipped layer connections and extracts information in two ways. The features are then concatenated and fed into a fully connected neural network. Finally, SoftMax is used to predict the labels of the traffic sign. The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset was used to train our proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The model was tested on 43 different traffic sign classes using 12630 images from the GTSRB dataset. The same dataset had a classification accuracy of 99.4%, whereas the existing lenet-based model had an accuracy of 97.1%.

One of the main intentions of security surveillance is detecting harmful objects such as guns, knives, axes, and iron rods. Digital surveillance in a situation where the police have used tear gas and water is even more challenging since the background could contain many artefacts.

All the fully connected dense layers of the YOLOv4 model were trained with a newly created dataset with different images captured in environments where tear gas is present and containing dangerous objects. Also, the developed dataset uses several Bags of Freebies to improve the detection rate. The model achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 82% for the test dataset when trained for 105 epochs.

To circumvent this problem, transfer learning is often applied, where a model trained on a large natural image corpus is adapted, or pre-trained, to model the medical problem. In this work, we consider transfer learning applied to a specific medical diagnostics problem, that of abnormality detection in the gastrointestinal tract of a human body using images obtained during endoscopy.

In this paper, a real-time detection model is proposed to identify handshake interactions in a range of realistic scenarios with multiple people in the scene and also detect multiple interactions in a single frame. The efficacy of the proposed model was evaluated across two different datasets on more than 3200 frames, thus enabling a robust localization model in different environments.

It has been shown beyond any doubt that bariatric surgery (BS) is the finest effective treatment for morbid obesity patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 40.0. After undergoing the surgery, it is required to monitor patients’ weight for eighteen months until they reach a healthy weight that falls within the normal BMI range (18.5— 24.9). In this study, we have analyzed records of bariatric patients registered at Colombo South Teaching Hospital, Kalubowila under four surgery types. Most of patients have lost track of their weight loss before reaching the eighteenth month, according to records, due to their incapacity to track their weight loss during the post-surgery period and the lack of continuing examination after the Bariatric Surgery. Therefore, some of the patients have to go through the same operation more than once, which will create a threat to their lives. The main aim of this study is to remotely track pre and post-surgery bariatric patients and allow them to keep track of their weight loss until they achieve their expected weight using a web based weight prediction system using Machine Learning. To predict the final weight, they might get after the surgery three machine Learning Algorithms are examined to get the highest accuracy. Feed Forward, Liner Regression and Random Forest Algorithms are taken into consideration to give the two output predictions. Pre-surgery and post-surgery data are taken as inputs. The final month’s weight is presented as the output in this system prior to the surgery and post to the surgery. In comparison with the algorithms, the random forest algorithm gives 97 and 95 percent accuracy after examining the data inputs under three algorithms in each prediction.","2164-7011","978-1-6654-2637-4","10.1109/ICIIS53135.2021.9660730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660730","Bariatric Surgery (BS);Body Mass Index (BMI);morbid obesity;Deep Learning;Neural Networks;Machine Learning.","Obesity;Machine learning algorithms;Hospitals;Surgery;Prediction algorithms;Indexes;Feeds","","2","","19","IEEE","3 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The primary objective here is to determine the optimal neural network (NN) model for classifying videos. For this purpose, three network models were developed to assess their ability to manage the videos, namely, Long short-term memory (LSTM), Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM), and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). The implementation results suggested that using a TCN structure may be well-suited for use with videos. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most often used image classification architecture, and these systems often serve as the basis for all three versions.

However, pre-adjustment of the droop for known load configuration is necessary. Under varying load condition, this will not give the optimum droop.

A physics-based nonparametric classification model based on threshold of fractional cloudiness of sky images was utilized to classify the images into 3 sky conditions: sunny, partially cloudy and overcast. Several ResNet architectures were first examined as end-to-end models and then they were tailored to each sky-condition to create sky-condition based sub models. For each ResNet architecture, results of the end-to-end model and sky-condition specific sub models were compared.

These models are accurate to study the stability due to low-frequency oscillations. However, ignorance of the aforementioned effects may introduce errors in the studies of sub-synchronous oscillations which may be created by non-conventional renewable-based power generators.

Polymeric HVDC cables have excellent electrical and thermal properties, especially in design stress which is comparatively low with mass and oil-impregnated insulation. However, having these benefits and large studies, the study about the effect of transients such as polarity reversal for different load and ambient conditions are still not well addressed. To have a successful long-term life of the cable, better understanding the effect of the change in environmental temperature, especially for the soil, is needed. During transients, the insulation undergoes high electro-thermal stress, and with the inclusion of the change in soil temperature can even be more catastrophic. In this paper, the actual electro-thermal model of the cable was considered for simulation along with the non-linear DC conductivity was incorporated in this model for enhancing the exact performance of the cable.

Annually, in 100 endemic countries, 50 – 100 million infections occur. The spread of the Dengue virus increases the need for immediate diagnosis of Dengue and begins the treatment as soon as possible in the earliest stages to avoid medical complications. However, diagnosis of Dengue on time and treatment in the early stages are the biggest challenges to hospitals. Specifically, depending heavily on human resources affects the prompt identification of Dengue patients and treating them. The delay in diagnosis of Dengue and human errors could lead to crucial medical situations. It is, therefore, important to reducing the time taken for Dengue diagnosis and this study tries to address this problem. In line with that, there is a significant need to automate the process of diagnosing Dengue as early as possible with higher efficiency along with utilizing fewer human resources, which could reduce human errors and delays. This study aims to identify the best performing Dengue diagnosis prediction model using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to automate the process of Dengue diagnosis. In developing the prediction model, feature selection is a crucial phase as it has been used to identify key attributes that directly impact the accuracy of the Dengue prediction model. In this study two approaches were used for the feature selection; Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Wrapper feature selection methods with Naïve Bayes, KNN, & J48 as classifiers. The PCA made a huge impact in developing higher accuracy Dengue diagnosis prediction model. Further, with PCA the initial 22-dimensional system was reduced to the 8-dimensional system with a cumulative variance of 59 %. A total of 360 Dengue diagnosis prediction models have developed using four different sets of feature combinations and with different hyperparameters. In conclusion, ANN with PCA, learning rate of 0.01, batch size of 32 and 200 epochs shows the highest accuracy of 73.41% and it is most suitable for the dengue diagnosis prediction based on current dataset.","2164-7011","978-1-6654-2637-4","10.1109/ICIIS53135.2021.9660723","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660723","dengue diagnosis prediction models;artificial neural Networks;wrapper feature selection;principal component analysis","Analytical models;Pain;Artificial neural networks;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Delays;Viruses (medical)","","","","20","IEEE","3 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Endangered Asian elephants are maimed or killed during such accidents, which also often results in orphaned or disabled elephants. Furthermore, railway services incur significant financial losses and disruptions to services annually due to such accidents. Most elephant-train collisions occur due to a lack of adequate reaction time due to poor driver visibility at sharp turns, night-time operation, and poor weather conditions. Initial investigations also indicate that most collisions occur in localised “hotspots” where elephant pathways/corridors intersect with railway tracks. Taking these factors into consideration, this work proposes the leveraging of recent developments in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technology to detect elephants using an RGB/infrared capable camera, around known hotspots along the railway track. The CNN was trained using a curated dataset of elephants collected on field visits to elephant sanctuaries and wildlife parks in Sri Lanka. With this vision-based detection system at its core, a prototype unit of an early warning system was designed and tested. Initial results indicate that detection accuracy is sufficient under varying lighting situations, provided that comprehensive training datasets that represent a wide range of challenging conditions are available. The overall hardware prototype was shown to be robust and reliable. We envision a network of such units may help contribute to reducing the problem of elephanttrain collisions and has the potential to act as an important surveillance mechanism in dealing with the broader issue of the human-elephant conflict.","2164-7011","978-1-6654-2637-4","10.1109/ICIIS53135.2021.9660651","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660651","Human-Elephant Conflict;Deep Learning;Computer Vision;Object Detection","Training;Surveillance;Wildlife;Prototypes;Alarm systems;Rail transportation;Convolutional neural networks","","3","","17","IEEE","3 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to archive the above, first, two methods were experimented to obtain a labeled image data set to train classification models where in the first method, clustering of images was done using Action Units(AU) identified from literature and the emotion levels of the images were determined through the resulted clusters and images are labeled according to the cluster they belonged to. In the second method, the image set is analyzed explicitly to identify AUs contributing to emotions rather than relying on those identified in literature and then the clustering of image set was done using those identified AUs to label the images similar to the first method. The two labeled data sets were used to train classification models with Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbour algorithms separately.Classification models showed better accuracy with data set produced using the second method. An overall F1 score, accuracy, precision and recall of 87% was obtained for the best classification model which is developed using the Random Forest algorithm to identify levels of emotions.

Hence, localization of programming languages to include cultural contexts relating to different native languages is attempted to combat this issue. This paper explores two main approaches to localization as (1) Direct keyword translation and (2) Design of independent non-English-based programming languages, and further investigates the aptitude of each technique towards the delivery of basic programming principles and concepts. Consequently, the embedded translation tool, ‘SimplyTrans’, is introduced with relation to the ‘Simply’ programming language following design science research approach, as an extension of the keyword mapping approach to localization.

This study aims to increase the optical absorption in organic solar cells by trapping the light inside the solar cell using surface texturing. Using a COMSOL model, it is examined how surface texturing on the two charge extraction layers, i.e., the back electrode and the top contact, affect the optical performance of the OSC. Also, different texture designs are optimised for their shape, dimensions and density to maximise efficiency. Findings in this research show that surface texturing is a successful method to increase the efficiency of organic solar cells. Further, the increase in efficiency depends on the thickness of the active layer material. The height of the texture design significantly impacts efficiency, while the shape and the density too play essential roles.

The qualitative approaches that have been adopted by the sport-strainers have gradually been translated into quantitative approaches using the contemporary technology. During the stroke-play, it’s difficult to understand the accuracy of the stroke and at the same time it’s hard to obtain a real-time feedback of a stroke during the practice sessions. Consequently, this will lead the way for a player to lose his psychological confidence and to decrease the efficiency and the quality of the stroke-play. During the research study, a mathematical model is developed to quantify the orientation and the position of a cricket bat. Subsequently, a real-time, inertial sensor-based positional tracking device which is integrated into the cricket bat has been developed. The micro-electromechanical-systems based accelerometer and gyroscope have been utilized as inertial measuring units in the study. Filtration process has been adopted to mitigate the noise associated with the signals and a complementary filter has been used in order to provide the user with the precise orientation. Moreover, testing has been conducted for roll, pitch motion and respective results have been acquired utilizing the fabricated bat device.

The operation of the hardware was tested on a ground-based platform. The graphical user interface of the ground station was designed using Visual Studio 2019. Uplink commands and telemetry and mission data are handled using this interface. The uplink command is transmitted at 433 MHz with a 62.5 kHz bandwidth. The data rate is approximately 4690 bps. The uplink command is modulated with the LoRa™ modulation technique with 20 dBm of output power. Telemetry and mission data downlink link specifications are the same as the specifications of the command uplink. CW Beacon transmits at 433 MHz with a 20 wpm data rate. The CW Beacon transmits 10 dBm of power and it is modulated with the CW Morse code. Telemetry and mission data downlink performance test was successfully done for a 100 m distance between the designed transmitter and the receiver. We believe that this can be extended to distances over 100 km by improving the antenna gain at the ground station as the antenna gain can easily be increased to a value greater than 15 dBi.","2164-7011","978-1-6654-2637-4","10.1109/ICIIS53135.2021.9660634","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660634","communication module;LoRa;Command Uplink;Telemetry and mission data downlink;CW beacon;Ground Station","Vibrations;Visualization;Satellites;Receivers;Downlink;Hardware;Telemetry","","1","","21","IEEE","3 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Though regular pick and place tasks are nonvalue added steps, it can replace expensive manual labor together by increasing efficiency. Hence, this paper discusses on the optimization of regular pick and place tasks using parallel manipulators. By evaluating on alternative manipulators, the 3-link parallel manipulator which is the delta robot was taken for presenting the model given in this paper. A simulation and a real-time operation were conducted for comparison of 2 designs of the delta robot, in relation to robot workspace and a component stress strain analysis. The robot kinematics were derived to define the robot workspace and for the dimensions of the mechanical components which were equally designed and tested. Fabricating was done using lathe machining and 3D-printing. The servo and visual systems were decided accordingly for the generalized pick and place application. Control and functionality with the input visual system and kinematics model were mapped and generated in a programming platform was transferred to the controller in order to drive the motors of the manipulator. This makes the robot end effector to activate and perform the picking and placing using the solenoid gripper. An accurate result in object detection, mapping, picking, and placing by the delta robot is thereby achieved. The presented model is feasible to be used in an industry which can accommodate regular pick and place tasks.","2164-7011","978-1-6654-2637-4","10.1109/ICIIS53135.2021.9660649","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660649","delta robot;visual-servo system;image processing;inverse kinematics;parallel manipulator;workspace;pick and place;MATLAB","Industries;Visualization;Service robots;Prototypes;Visual systems;Manipulators;Task analysis","","","","15","IEEE","3 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The controller was developed by 3D modelling the manipulator using SOLIDWORKSTM to extract the latter important parameters and then using such data in the MATLABTM SimulinkTM environment for controller development. The performance of the controller was evaluated for percentage overshoot, settling time and the steady state error for step inputs. Further, the performance was evaluated by giving the spline coordinates to the system and considering the tracking error.

Human following while carrying loads is such a challenging task for service robots, as the robot needs to traverse in an unknown dynamic environment with the crowd, obstacles, varying lighting, floor conditions, and different structural components. Therefore, it requires several techniques: uniquely identifying the target and real-time tracking without losing the target often, avoiding static and dynamic obstacles in the path while maintaining a safe distance that does not appear threatening to the person, adapting to different walking speeds, and the target attraction-based acceleration. In this research, a robust vision-based target detection system that detects a custom-designed tri-colored belt with short initialization time, and a computationally less complex Robot Control Architecture was proposed using Fuzzy logic and Subsumption architecture to achieve these goals. The robust performance of the proposed approach is illustrated by the experimental results on a real-world robot which maintains accuracy, hardware cost as well as simplicity of the system and ensures that the robot follows the target person stably, smoothly, and safely.","2164-7011","978-1-6654-2637-4","10.1109/ICIIS53135.2021.9660756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660756","fuzzy logic;subsumption;computer vision;human following;smooth moving;mobile robot;color belt","Legged locomotion;Target tracking;Service robots;Robot control;Lighting;Computer architecture;Belts","","1","","34","IEEE","3 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With recent technological developments fleet monitoring has become far more feasible and their features have improved beyond the classical location tracking, which has made them popular among the fleet administrators. In location tracking, a continuous stream of GPS locations with a shorter time interval between adjacent locations helps to map the traversed path accurately. The shorter the time interval between adjacent GPS locations, the larger the number of GPS locations obtained during a given time interval and the higher the accuracy of the resultant traversed path. However, the larger the number of GPS locations in the continuous GPS data stream, the larger the size of the payload that has to be transmitted to the server from the tracking device at the vehicle. The main contribution of this work is to propose a methodology to reduce the size of the payload to be transmitted to the server, while holding the accuracy of the traversed path. Our results show that the size of the payload of GPS location data can be reduced more than 75 percent with the application of proposed methodology.","2164-7011","978-1-6654-2637-4","10.1109/ICIIS53135.2021.9660675","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660675","GPS;fleet monitoring;location tracking;compression;bandwidth optimization","Costs;Bandwidth;Receivers;Organizations;Servers;Monitoring;Optimization","","","","13","IEEE","3 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Initially, a simple dipole antenna with a single T-match structure was designed having overall dimensions of 163 mm × 16 mm × 1.6 mm.

Then the T-match was modified by adding another bridge parallel to the T-match and by folding the dipole. The dimensions of its structure were optimized by using parametric optimization to match the impedance. The impedance match between the proposed antenna and the chip concerning the power transmission coefficient is 0.998. The simulated S11 ≤ -10 dB bandwidth is 690 MHz - 970 MHz.
