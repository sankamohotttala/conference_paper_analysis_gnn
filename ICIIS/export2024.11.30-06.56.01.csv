Support Vector Machine is the algorithm used for the prediction of the parameters. A cascaded network approach has been used where stage-wise division has been done to obtain different parameters depending on their correlation with each other. The cascaded network takes insulation resistances as input to predict breakdown and interfacial tension which are further used along with colour as input to predict water content which is further used to predict the acidity.

However, a severe scarcity of potable water persists in many countries, as only 2.5% of this water is available as freshwater in groundwater, lakes and rivers.

Currently, existing technologies for water purification such as Multistage Flash (MSF), Multiple Effect, Vapor Compression (VC), Reverse Osmosis (RO), Ion Exchange, Electrodialysis, and Capacitive Deionization (CDI) require a lot of energy, leading to environmental pollution caused by the consumption of fossil fuels. Desalination of saline water using solar stills is an effective solution to overcome these problems. Solar energy is abundant, everlasting, economical and does not cause emission of greenhouse gases. This paper studies the mathematical modelling of a single slope single basin solar still and a still coupled with evacuated tube collectors.

These applications are not feasible without 5G technologies because they need high-speed communication and the number of their users is also very large. In fog computing, fog nodes are allocated to the IoT users for running their heavy jobs. Many variants of a centralized reverse auction are reported in the literature for allocation of fog nodes. However, these auction methods have some major drawbacks such as one-point failure, utilization of only winner's resources in a single round of auction, and a large number of message exchanges among participating entities in auction. Therefore, in this work, we have proposed a Decentralized Auction based Fog Node Allocation mechanism (DAFNA) that inherits all the properties of a traditional auction as well as improves the utilization of fog resources. In DAFNA, the concept of contention window and waiting time is used that makes the auction decentralized in nature. DAFNA allows fog resource providers to participate in more than one auction simultaneously for the same resource that improves the utilization of the resource. In addition, DAFNA also reduces the number of message exchanges among participating entities in auction in comparison with traditional auction. A case study is given to show the working of the proposed auction. The proposed auction mechanism is an application of 5G because it is decentralized in nature and requires speedy communication among participating entities.","2164-7011","978-1-7281-8524-8","10.1109/ICIIS51140.2020.9342683","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9342683","5G;fog computing;resource allocation;auction","5G mobile communication;Smart cities;Medical services;Resource management;Internet of Things;Edge computing;Information systems","","8","","28","IEEE","8 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There have been several research works on detection and prevention of SQL injection attacks. However, still there is an absence of an advanced single tools for both identification and mitigation of SQL injection attacks. We have proposed an approach to identify and mitigate SQL injection attacks using a single tool and it allows software testers to identify the SQL injection vulnerabilities of their web applications during the testing stages. The proposed approach is based on parameterized queries and user input validation. Our results show that the tool provides 100% accurate and efficient results on identification and mitigation of SQL vulnerabilities.","2164-7011","978-1-7281-8524-8","10.1109/ICIIS51140.2020.9342703","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9342703","Structured Query Language Injection Attack (SQLIA);Web Application;Vulnerability Identification;Vulnerability Mitigation","Structured Query Language;Organizations;SQL injection;Tools;Software;Security;Testing","","6","","13","IEEE","8 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to minimize the electrical power losses during transmission and distribution phase, it is always advantageous to set up the receiving end step down substation near the load center. Enhancement of urban boundary and concentrated electrical load demand in the middle of city, it is required to set up the step-down substation not only near the demand center but in the middle of the city. Setting up a HV substation in the middle of congested city, especially in a country like India, put forward novel changes for the transcom / discom. The space available is less for the newly proposed substation and existing substation are getting more loaded due to increasing demand. For the HV equipment manufacturer, this situation calls for optimizing the equipment design not only to reduce the footprint but also minimize the required ground clearances.This paper focused on step wise study to optimize the footprint of a three-phase high voltage surge arrester (HVSA) and minimize the ground clearance from the side by objects. HVSA is a critical equipment in a receiving end substation. HVSA is having its inherent design criticality, as it needs to offer the variable low resistance path in tandem with the insulation coordination of the system and bypass HV surges to ground. While reducing the footprint of the SA, thorough electric field analysis is essential to ensure the basic functionality of it.

These outdated techniques have to be replaced with automated techniques. In this paper, we proposed a new irrigation system, which works based on the latest IoT technology to reduce the wastage of water and it reduces manual labor to irrigate the crops. The main objective of the proposed irrigation system is to supply the required amount of water to the crop based on the type and stage of the crop. The proposed irrigation system pumps the water to the crop based on the type, area, and date of the plantation of the crop, and these parameters are registered by the farmer through the IoT-based Android App. The designed irrigation system uses ESP8266 Controller, Moisture, and Water Level sensors for irrigating the crops. The problem with the moisture sensor-based irrigation system is supplying water to the crop only based on the sensor reading, but different crops require different amounts of water at different stages. Hence, in this paper, we divided the total crop duration into five different stages. Based on the type and stage, the crop gets irrigated automatically using the motor incorporated in the circuit and the motor action can be controlled using the algorithm designed for ESP8266. Another problem with the moisture sensor is it shows maximum reading even when the water level is low. This problem can be resolved by using a water level sensor and hence, the proposed smart irrigation system is superior to the existing moisture sensor-based irrigation system. The key factor involved in the proposed methodology is fixing the water level of the crop instead of the quantity of water. The water level is measured by using a level sensor and it measures the water level in terms of the height of water in the field. Hence, the proposed irrigation system works efficiently in both rainy and high-temparature conditions.","2164-7011","978-1-7281-8524-8","10.1109/ICIIS51140.2020.9342736","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9342736","Smart irrigation;Water Level;Mobile App;Date of plantation;Type of crop;Area of the land","Irrigation;Moisture;Manuals;Sensor systems;Real-time systems;Intelligent sensors;Water resources","","16","","20","IEEE","8 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So, voids and impurities will definitely reduce the dielectric strength of a dielectric. Cables can also cause disturbances due to EMI and EMS if the metallic shield is damaged; this case is mainly with the Coaxial cables which are used in industries. So, basically what is done is in this project is two separate analysis has been conducted for the cable (1.) due to water voids and inhibition of field due to water voids with nano filler Titanium Oxide. This is performed by simulating the model of XLPE cable with water void and with water void and nano filler. From the simulations it is inferred that the field effect is higher outside the periphery of the water voids and as field interacts with the other water voids, it creates a high electrical stress channel. Titanium Nano Filler has been added to check if its addition is helping in the inhibition of the path of electric field distribution. The whole simulation has been done considering constant conductivity and permittivity of the material and (2.) analysis of the electromagnetic interference caused by the cable. In this section we analyze the cable which is ruptured and due to which a slot is created through which electric field is leaking. Different slot angle has been created for the analysis of electromagnetic field and exposure of electromagnetic interference is plotted as line graph to check how much field is emerging out on increasing and decreasing the axial slot angle. This will give insight about the amount of EMI interfering with the nearby objects which is very crucial for the High Voltage equipment's else the losses will increase significantly.","2164-7011","978-1-7281-8524-8","10.1109/ICIIS51140.2020.9342714","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9342714","COMSOL Multiphysics;XLPE;Coaxial cable;nano filler;electromagnetic interference;water voids","Power cables;Electromagnetic interference;Power cable insulation;Electric fields;Trees - insulation;Permittivity;Stress","","","","10","IEEE","8 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the most common energy storage, Lithium-Ion batteries are used in many applications. Such batteries are comprised of modules and the modules consist of series connected and parallel connected cells. When the batteries are in frequent operation, the State-of-health of the cells deteriorate. As a result, the cells will lose their storage capacity and cell voltages will deviate from their nominal values. Therefore, there is a possibility of having damaged cells within a battery. Identifying such damaged cells is important to maintain the battery at high state-of-health and thus to make sure the battery can be operated to its full expected life time, while delivering the expected performance. For that, accurate methods must be available in locating the degraded cells within the battery. This paper reviews the state of the art to detect degraded cells, where almost all of them are limited to one dimensional cases; i.e., either parallel connected cell arrays or series connected cell arrays. Since such approaches have limited applications to this two dimensional problem, this paper proposes a new method to identify faulty cells in a two dimensional array of cells in a battery by measuring array voltage, current and the temperatures.","2164-7011","978-1-7281-8524-8","10.1109/ICIIS51140.2020.9342642","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9342642","Energy storage;cell degradation;battery modelling","Temperature measurement;Lithium-ion batteries;Fault diagnosis;Voltage measurement;Current measurement;Conferences;Information systems","","","","26","IEEE","8 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Every action is taken such that the reward value is maximized. The reward becomes maximum if setpoint and the current ball position are as close as possible. So, a ball position from the sensor, in terms of reward is taken as feedback to predict the next action. The predicted action is the angle of the beam which needs to be turned by the motor.

Energization and voltage polarity inversions in DC insulation systems result in electric field transients that may last many hours, and load fluctuations can generate variable temperature profile transients. Inception of partial discharge during such repeated transients can significantly reduce insulation life. This paper addresses the behavior of electric field and partial discharge during voltage transients, the influence of such transients on life and how to measure partial discharges during transients and DC steady state. The effect of voltage transients on life of DC insulation systems is modelled with and without partial discharges, and it is shown that the presence of partial discharges can affect dramatically the life, even if it is restricted only during voltage transients.

The fundamental idea behind these methods is to find the Thevenin equivalents of the system, and then determine the voltage stability margin based on the equivalent circuits. Some approaches also include the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), for online monitoring of voltage stability margins. These methods are really fast as compared to the other methods. It has been shown that if we can obtain the phase angles and voltage magnitude in real-time from the phasor measurement units (PMU), then the voltage stability margins can be obtained in real-time and we can initiate voltage stability control methods. We are going to discuss Thevenin's equivalent methods and Artificial Intelligence methods in detail in this paper.

In high voltage cables partial discharge pulses originated at a particular site in the cable can propagate throughout the entire length of the cable. A better understanding of this pulse propagation can be achieved through simulation. Hence in this paper a comparative study is conducted on two high voltage cable models one with and the other without a spherical slot in finite element analysis (FEA) software which is COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS and the propagation characteristics of the pulse injected at one end of the cable is studied and analyzed.

QWK has been widely used as the evaluation measure for various medical imaging problems, where, the class labels have a natural ordering, e.g., no Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), mild DR, and severe DR. The easiest way to treat the classification problem with these ordinal labels is to consider the problem as a multiclass classification problem and apply the Cross Entropy (CE) loss. However, when applying CE loss the order of the classes becomes meaningless, i.e., the loss will be same if a healthy image is classified into mild DR or severe DR. At the same time, the QWK score will be severely affected if a healthy image is classified into severe DR than mild DR. The most appropriate way to get a better classification score is to optimize the evaluation measure itself. i.e., directly optimize the QWK statistics. However, this optimization may hinder the learning, and may lead to sub-optimal solutions, and therefore, may give lower performance than expected. On the other hand, Ordinal Regression (OR) based approaches also can be used for such problems. The main focus of this work is to investigate which loss function (CE loss, QWK loss or OR loss) is the most appropriate one to the Convolutional Neural Network-based ordinal classification problems, where, QWK is used as the evaluation measure. Experiments on two public datasets, Diabetic Retinopathy and Prostate Cancer, with two different network architectures suggest that directly optimizing QWK is the better choice when small networks are used. On the other hand, we found that for large networks OR based loss function gives better performance.","2164-7011","978-1-7281-8524-8","10.1109/ICIIS51140.2020.9342711","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9342711","Convolutional neural network;Diabetic retinopathy;Image classification;Loss functions;Prostate cancer","Weight measurement;Retinopathy;Loss measurement;Time measurement;Diabetes;Convolutional neural networks;Prostate cancer","","10","","18","IEEE","8 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Emphysema is a type of CPOD (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and it is due to malfunctioning of lungs. Breathing becomes difficult with this disease. It occurs due to the stretching and damaging of air sacs in the lungs. In this work, an ensemble approach is proposed using the features extracted from the last global average pooling layer of the pre trained convolutional neural networks which are trained on `Imagenet' data set. These features are given to an Error Correcting Output Code classifier with the base classifier being Support Vector Machine. Three best pre trained networks are selected based on the average classification accuracy. An ensemble of the three classifiers is considered. Based on the majority voting, weighed average probability and highest probability strategy, the test images labels are identified. Hold out validation (80% training and 20% testing) is used to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm. A popular database of computed tomography emphysema images is chosen to validate our proposal. A peak classification accuracy of 100% and an average classification accuracy of 95.88% is obtained with a combination of Resnet18, Shufflenet, and Resnet 101 pre trained networks with the averaged probability as a choice in the prediction of labels of test images.

Previous literature focused mainly on occluded face detection or facial expression, which were unsuitable for the application of detecting human faces wearing masks. Hence, to overcome the issue, this work proposes a Convolutional Neural Network-based model that uses region proposals to detect masked and nonmasked faces. The depth of the Convolutional Neural Network was increased by using residual skip-connections. The model was implemented using TensorFlow Object Detection API and was pre-trained over the COCO dataset. A secondary outcome of the paper was to collect a dataset of high resolution masked and nonmasked faces for training deep learning frameworks, due to the lack of datasets available for this task. The proposed model was compared with the SSD Inception V2 model [1] and the SSD MobileNet V2 model [2] in the context of detection accuracy (mAP). The experiments highlight that the proposed framework achieves a detection accuracy (total mAP) of 85.82%, on the collected dataset. The results are significantly better in detecting non-masked faces with a detection accuracy (mAP) of 98.61% while it is 68.72% accurate in detecting masked faces.

SMAs are a class of actuators with the intrinsic capability of varying the stiffness on actuation and hence the measurand can be quantified in terms of the variation of the stiffness of the material during actuation.

By using this knowledge, companies can determine which consumers are the most profitable. This can be done with the method called customer segmentation. The Customer segmentation is a breakdown of the broad database of customers into subparts. The subparts members have some common features, although, in other subparts, these features are different. Most scientists consider various ways of segmenting customers with multiple clustering algorithms in different fields with the support of data mining. In the data analytical field, there are many techniques associated with the segmentation process. To order to identify the target consumer audience, companies use traditional market segmentation. It ensures that marketers will target their marketing strategies on the most likely to attract customers. Also, businesses may adopt more effective marketing strategies following the successful customer segmentation process and thereby reduce the uncertainty associated with an investment. Here, the k-mean was used as an algorithm for the segmentation process to segment the customers. In this study, determine the six clusters base on the annual income and spending score.

The efficacy of this approach could be used to scale and develop automated systems that could predict the likeliness of Covid-19 based on laboratory tests that are readily accessible. From the features presented to us in the dataset, we are able to predict with 87.0 - 97.4 percent accuracy at a 95 percent confidence level that a patient is suffering from Covid-19 when biomarkers are taken into consideration.

To detect skin, we use skin colour detection and softening to remove extra background information from the image, and then use background subtraction to detect the PSR. Moreover, to avoid the background information, we use the kernelised correlation filters (KCF) algorithm to track the detected PSR. The image size of the PSR is then resized to 50px * 50px and then fed into the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify eight yogic hand gestures. The deep CNN architecture developed in this study that is a modified VGGNet. The above process of tracking and recognition is repeated with a ranking algorithm to produce a real-time impression, and the system's execution continues until the hand leaves the camera range.

The reliability of an aircraft engine can be measured using readings of different sensors. In this work, the performances of different machine learning algorithms are studied, and finally, a better algorithm is suggested for predicting RUL. Additionally, a classification approach is proposed to classify the health state of an engine. The experimental results show that the XGBoost gives the best prediction accuracy in terms of root mean square error. The proposed LightGBM-based classifier further enhances the maintenance prediction based on the health state of the aircraft engine.

Since it affects different individuals differently and to different extents, it is very challenging to diagnose and differentiate from other neurodevelopmental disorders. The earlier it is diagnosed, the better it is for the individual, as an intervention protocol can be charted at the earliest. Research shows that early intervention can be very beneficial in the long term as the affected individuals' symptoms can be reduced to a great extent and in some cases they may not show up on the spectrum at all, but the lack of awareness and objective diagnostic tools makes it difficult to diagnose at an early age. The objective nature of the automated approaches to the screening of Autism Spectrum Disorder would be considered as a viable option for a second opinion and by an extension also an efficient screening process after which the patients would be referred to a therapist. Tests like eye tracking, detection of physical attributes via wearable and static IoT devices, classification on MRI scans and voice prosody detection techniques are easily reproducible and more time efficient than a one on one interview session with a therapist. In this paper we explore the various innovations made in automating the screening process.

Swift and accurate detection of plant leaf diseases is essential to reduce the intensity of the disease thereby minimising economic losses. Here, a deep learning-based Inception-v3 methodology has been proposed to identify and classify various plant leaf diseases using plant leaf image datasets. The approach also employs Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to augment the limited datasets. Different classes of GANs are adopted for experimental analysis to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. From the experiment's results, it is observed that the DCGAN model achieves the highest accuracy and performs better than CGAN as a data augmentation technique in terms of Class Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score and Accuracy. The DCGAN model also outperforms in terms of evaluation parameters when compared with other techniques in literature.","2164-7011","978-1-7281-8524-8","10.1109/ICIIS51140.2020.9342728","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9342728","Deep Learning;Data augmentation;Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs);Inception-v3;Plant disease","Economics;Plants (biology);Conferences;Generative adversarial networks;Data models;Diseases;Information systems","","3","","19","IEEE","8 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

COBOT enhances the image with octet encoding so that minute features of an image can be utilized for classification and retrieval. Loss of features is comparatively very less in COBOT when compared with other feature descriptors. COBOT can be explained in terms of orientation and octet. Bi orientation refers to both clockwise and anti-clockwise movements whereas, octet property divides the whole image in eight equal patches and extracts information from each of them. COBOT discern and augment the lines, corner point and texture information in the precinct octet across diverse directions. To further improve the robustness, multiresolution Gaussian filters with COBOT is incorporated and it is termed as MEGABOT.

We build sarcasm detectors using neural networks and attempt to understand how a computer learns the patterns of sarcasm. The input to our project consists of sequences that are labeled sarcastic or non-sarcastic. These sequences come from two different datasets containing news headlines and social media commentary.

We can use social media like Twitter to detect crimes related activities. Because Twitter users sometimes convey messages related to his or her surrounding environment via Twitter. In this paper, we proposed a machine learning approach to detect the crimes and the location of the crimes.

The power, performance and area (PPA) constraints limit the number of MACs available in these accelerators. The convolution layers which require huge number of MACs are often partitioned into multiple iterative sub-tasks. This puts huge pressure on the available system resources such as interconnect and memory bandwidth. The optimal partitioning of the feature maps for these sub-tasks can reduce the bandwidth requirement substantially. Some accelerators avoid off-chip or interconnect transfers by implementing local memories; however, the memory accesses are still performed and a reduced bandwidth can help in saving power in such architectures. In this paper, we propose a first order analytical method to partition the feature maps for optimal bandwidth and evaluate the impact of such partitioning on the bandwidth. This bandwidth can be saved by designing an active memory controller which can perform basic arithmetic operations. It is shown that the optimal partitioning and active memory controller can achieve up to 40% bandwidth reduction.","2164-7011","978-1-7281-8524-8","10.1109/ICIIS51140.2020.9342717","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9342717","DNN;Interconnect bandwidth;optimization;active memory controller;architecture","Power demand;Neural networks;Memory management;Random access memory;Bandwidth;Machine learning;Information systems","","","","14","IEEE","8 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This transition, aimed at maintaining the educational delivery continuum in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, reinforces the belief in technology as the pre-eminent solution regardless of its pervasive challenges and implications. A sizeable population in developing countries like India lack equal access to minimal enabling resources and technical know-how to keep pace with the transition. Data collected for this study using surveys and interviews from final semester undergraduate students who undertook remote lessons and technology intervened online examinations for the first time during the COVID -19 pandemic at a technical university in India was indicative of the same. The findings of this research revealed that a considerable number of students lack access to individualized facilities, resources, and a conducive environment at home, required to avail digital assets for their education, which deter the fair and efficient implementation of online examinations in the digital present. The results of this study further showed, how, unequal educational opportunities arising out of inefficient implementation, disadvantage a significant group of students, from primarily weaker economic backgrounds of society.
