We also developed a new dataset containing knives, swords, axes, stones, sticks, and objects commonly associated with arson. The proposed Accelerated YOLOv4 algorithm was trained and tested using the developed dataset. Its performance was compared to the standard YOLOv4 algorithm. The performance evaluation of the detection models showed that the Accelerated YOLOv4 model achieved higher precision scores than the YOLOv4 model for most objects. The mean average precision (mAP) of the Accelerated YOLOv4 model was 86%, which is higher than the mAP of the YOLOv4 model, which was 72%.

Further, online and offline testing are carried out to assess the health condition of the transformer to avoid inadvertent failure. In order to carry out routine maintenance (RM) and testing, the transformer needs to be switched off, causing power interruptions for many consumers if alternative arrangements are not possible. Thus, it is important to investigate the possibility of sharing the load of a particular transformer with other transformers in the neighboring transformers. Thus, this research proposed a method to estimate a load of neighboring transformers on a particular day and time, which allowed for the planning of outages with minimum power interruption to the consumers. This study has used loading data of four 132 kV grid substations which can share the distribution loads among and three different machine learning techniques have been used to estimate the load of the transformer at a particular time of the day. This research investigated the performance of load data prediction algorithms such as SARIMA, FB-Prophet, and LSTM.

However, this has also led to the proliferation of insincere questions, which lack a neutral undertone and are not intended for learning. The posting of such queries can lead to chaos, necessitating the need for monitoring and discerning which questions should be published to maintain the platform's quality. The classification of insincere questions is crucial for maintaining the quality of these platforms. Detecting insincere questions can enhance user experience and foster a healthy and safe environment for online discussions. While Quora previously relied on manual reviews, the application of algorithms, particularly those from the field of Deep Learning, a subset of Machine Learning, has made this process more efficient and accessible. This paper reviews various approaches and algorithms used in classifying insincere questions on Quora, their benefits, and drawbacks. It provides insights into how Deep Learning can enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of insincere question classification on online platforms.

Traditional manual grain counting methods are time-consuming and subject to human error, and automated methods have the potential to improve accuracy and save time. In this study, we aimed to develop an image analysis-based method to automatically quantify the number of grains in a quicker manner. The 576 grain images were collected manually, and labelImg tagging tool used to annotate to generate a text file with their respective positions by drawing bounding boxes manually. The datasets consist were separated into three groups: training, validation, and test. For object detection, the YOLOv5, YOLOv4, and YOLOv3 algorithms represent cutting-edge deep learning frameworks. They replace the tedious and error-prone manual counting process by precisely identifying and counting grains in images obtained from agricultural fields. This technique helps to increase grain counting's precision and effectiveness. We believe this method will be extremely beneficial in guiding the development of high throughput systems for counting the number of grains in other crops as it performs well with a wide range of backgrounds, picture sizes, grain sizes, as well as various quantities of grain crowding. When compared to the other two approaches, YOLOv4 performed well in terms of accuracy, speed, and robustness (97.65%), demonstrating that the suggested strategy is competitive with other cutting-edge deep networkst.","2164-7011","979-8-3503-2363-4","10.1109/ICIIS58898.2023.10253539","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253539","smart agriculture;deep learning;grain counting;YOLO","Deep learning;Training;Grain size;Manuals;Production;Object detection;Tagging","","","","28","IEEE","20 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, non-intrusive techniques to identify human-human interactions in public spaces play an important role in the curtailment of disease spread. This paper proposes a novel computer vision-based system that identifies multiple co-occurring dyadic (two-person) interactions in a crowded scenario and classifies them into six action classes. Human skeletons are extracted from the RGB videos to eliminate the background noise improving the overall detection accuracy. Two approaches have been used for the classifier: X3D-M and X3D-M+Attention. The latter achieves higher classification accuracy due to the ability of the attention layer to capture the long-distance interdependence of video frames. The efficacy of the proposed model was evaluated across two different datasets on more than 5000 frames, thus enabling a robust detection model in different environments. The proposed model is the first dyadic interaction detector in the wild, which enables it to be used in public spaces and thereby identify and mitigate transmission of respiratory diseases.","2164-7011","979-8-3503-2363-4","10.1109/ICIIS58898.2023.10253565","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253565","surveillance;social distancing;dyadic interactions;computer vision;deep learning;attention","Pulmonary diseases;Organizations;Human factors;Detectors;Video surveillance;Social factors;Skeleton","","","","46","IEEE","20 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research project has discovered a problem associated with contemporary blockchain consensus protocols, which has an impact on both users of blockchain technology and investors in cryptocurrencies. The question of whether current blockchain platforms are truly decentralized has been raised by the blockchain community over a period of time. The most popular blockchains use Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), or a combination of both, but both systems have limitations in terms of decentralization. Several alternative consensus protocols have emerged recently, but none have achieved total decentralization or welcomed any level user to be the next miner or forger. Therefore, true decentralization of a blockchain system is more challenging as most of the popular consensus protocols were invented to accommodate decentralization but eventually, driven by the centralization of power. This paper proposes a truly decentralized consensus protocol that is capable of avoiding the centralization of power even in the future regardless of the number of peers. The protocol also makes sure it avoids the use of specialized hardware resources, decreases the level of energy consumption, and encourages network activities. Additionally, the novel consensus protocol offers a more democratic and fair approach to blockchain consensus.","2164-7011","979-8-3503-2363-4","10.1109/ICIIS58898.2023.10253613","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253613","Blockchain;Consensus protocol;Distributed ledger technology;Decentralized network;Incentive;Security","Energy consumption;Proof of Work;Hardware;Consensus protocol;Cryptocurrency;Information systems","","","","24","IEEE","20 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In spite of the costs, labelling and categorizing entities are essential for NLP tasks such as semantic evaluation. Even though annotation can be done by non-experts in most cases, due to the fact that this requires human labour, the process is costly. Another major challenge encountered in data annotation is maintaining annotation consistency. Annotation efforts are typically carried out by teams of multiple annotators. The annotations need to maintain consistency in relation to both the domain truth and annotation format while reducing human errors. Annotating a specialized domain that deviates significantly from the general domain, such as fantasy literature, will see a significant amount of human error and annotator disagreement. So it is vital that proper guidelines and error reduction mechanisms are enforced. One way to enforce these constraints is by using a specialized application. Such an app can ensure that the notations are consistent, and the labels can be pre-defined or restricted reducing the room for errors. In this paper, we present SHADE, an annotation software that can be used to annotate entities in the high fantasy literature domain Dungeons and Dragons extracted from the Forgotten Realms Fandom Wiki.","2164-7011","979-8-3503-2363-4","10.1109/ICIIS58898.2023.10253606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253606","data annotation;data extraction;natural language processing;fantasy literature;dungeons and dragons","Annotations;Semantics;Information services;Manuals;Software;Internet;Labeling","","1","","23","IEEE","20 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in the cases where one of the considered language pairs is a low-resource language, the existing top-down parallel data such as corpora are lacking in both tally and quality due to the dearth of human annotation. Therefore, for low-resource languages, it is more feasible to move in the bottom-up direction where finer granular pairs such as dictionary datasets are developed first. They may then be used for mid-level tasks such as supervised multilingual word embedding alignment. These in turn can later guide higher-level tasks in the order of aligning sentence or paragraph text corpora used for Machine Translation (MT). Even though more approachable than generating and aligning a massive corpus for a low-resource language, for the same reason of apathy from larger research entities, even these finer granular data sets are lacking for some low-resource languages. We have observed that there is no free and open dictionary data set for the low-resource language, Sinhala.

A significant barrier to the widespread use of digital wallets is the potential loss of the private key of a wallet and the consequent irrecoverable loss of wallet contents. The use of easy-to-remember private keys or easy-to-locate storing of private keys could result in the theft of private keys and wallet contents. A solution that allows the use of strong private keys along with a scheme to recover a lost private key is essential for the practical use of social wallets as a commodity service for non-specialist users.

On the other, there is also a need to expose the students to concepts like Industry 4.0 and DT, where a virtual replica of the physical system is created and connected in real time. Therefore, this study aimed to establish DT connectivity between the physical and digital models of a conveyor available in a manufacturing system in a learning factory (LF). The integration of existing hardware with a simulated platform, utilizing an IoT-enabled environment and operating the hardware through VR setups, enabled seamless interaction between the physical and virtual realms, enhancing control, visualization, and optimization of hardware systems. Moreover, in addition to facilitating the DT, a VR platform has been integrated with the digital model of the conveyor system, enabling control of the physical system through a VR setup. The positioning accuracy of the conveyor carried pallet was tested for several locations, and results revealed that the digital model indicates the pallet position to the accuracy level of the nearest 2.5 mm.

This paper focuses on developing the “Agri Sri” mobile application that connects farmers with retailers, creating a marketplace to enable convenient and more efficient transactions, and providing essential information to the farmers. This approach aims to create an online market to minimize the effect of intermediaries while connecting farmers and retailers with a profitable price for their agricultural products allowing direct transactions between the two. With the proposed platform the farmers could find the right buyers at competitive open bids incorporating the blockchain distributed ledger technology. The proposed platform also allows for smarter synchronized product supply chains by leveraging the experiences of its users and finding innovative ways to improve the way they interact. The proposed platform also facilitates features like an online marketplace facilitating buying, selling, renting, database, prediction and analyzing, calling center, updates, and notifications. The “Agri Sri” also facilitates connecting and collaborating with retailers on market trends, pricing, and distribution methods with local retailers, providing real-time price comparison and location tracking features to help the rural economy.

However, one of the most challenging aspects of online learning is being aware of and supportive of students' emotional needs. This is because emotions play a crucial role in predicting student learning levels. In a traditional in-class setup, educators can easily recognize a student's emotions and adjust their teaching methods accordingly to match the students' learning levels. However, the same is much more challenging in an online environment as the available online meeting tools do not include emotion detection as part of their product due to various factors, such as technical limitations and the complexity of accurately detecting emotions through an online interface. Therefore, this work proposes a realtime student emotion detection system in an online education environment to change the delivery methods accordingly. First, we identify the five most influential emotions in an education environment: boredom, anxiety, enjoyment, anger, and surprise, based on the analysis of the literature. Then, we propose a CNN-based facial emotion recognition system based on these five emotions. To design and test the model, we designed a dataset based on images captured in a real university online learning setup and merged it with publicly available DAiSEE and FER 2013 datasets. Finally, we evaluate the model's performance based on classification accuracy, precision, recall, and other standard metrics.

Deep sea exploration is of great interest for marine science, seabed mapping, mining operations, and underwater cable operations. One of the biggest challenges in deep sea exploration is the communication among the exploration team. The typical radio communication technologies fail underwater due to the severe attenuation of the salty water. Therefore, other frequency bands such as the visible light spectrum are being trialled for underwater communication. In this regard, this paper presents a visible light communication system that can operate in deep sea conditions. The paper presents a comprehensive communication channel modelling for the midnight zone of the deep sea region and evaluates the performance of the proposed system. Further, the paper proposes a number of network topologies in which the exploration teams can operate and the performance of these topologies are evaluated for using bit error rate.

Hence, Bluetooth and related research have received significant research attention, especially antenna design and miniaturization. Indeed significant research efforts have been made in the literature for the development and miniaturization of 2.4 GHz Bluetooth antennas. However, they possess certain limitations; for instance, the nonplanar antennas (external monopole and dipole) are difficult to fabricate, require more space, and are expensive. Similarly, the planar antennas (monopole, inverted F, meander line) proposed in the literature require a large ground area, more keep-out space, possess low bandwidth, low gain, and are difficult to tune. Hence, in this regard, we have proposed a compact & small, easily manufacturable low-cost planar antenna that exploits the curved-shaped structure for better impedance matching, tuning, radiation efficiency, and smaller physical size. In particular, the proposed antenna offers a radiation bandwidth of 130 MHz, 1.89 dBi antenna gain, and an omnidirectional radiation pattern.

Although substantial advancements have been achieved in this area for widely-spoken languages such as English, the focus on the development of GEC tools for less common languages such as Sinhala has been inadequate. Sinhala is a language spoken by more than 16 million people in Sri Lanka, known for its rich morphology, and complex grammar structures that pose a challenge for Sinhala GEC systems. This paper presents a novel GEC approach that utilizes Google machine translation, cross-linguistic knowledge and rule-based techniques augmented by machine learning to analyze complex Sinhala sentences. We focus on analyzing Sinhala verb agreement rules, and object validation rules in Sinhala active voice sentences. Additionally, we address the major challenges in Sinhala GEC, such as subject and object detection and the detection of grammatical features of nouns, including animacy, gender, and number. Our findings indicate that the GEC methodology presented achieved an accuracy of 75.61 %. Additionally, the gender and number detection components produced an accuracy of 90.89% and 92.33%, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in identifying and correcting errors in complex Sinhala sentences.

However, it is possible to monitor the electrical activity of the fetus in the mother's womb using a fetal electrocardiogram (FECG). Although FECG can be acquired invasively, most of the equipment is designed for the non-invasive approach. Current research work has shown the use of non-invasive FECG signals, obtained using six electrodes (one chest electrode and five abdominal electrodes named AI, AII, AIII, AIV and AV), to identify minor abnormalities in fetal heart development. The raw FECG signal contains noise components, such as power line interference, baseline wandering and motion artifacts, which can affect the accuracy of the signal. Therefore, this study proposes the use of Symlet Wavelet decomposition, digital filters for signal conditioning and QRS complex isolation prior to the feature extraction for a reliable assessment. Since the FECG signals are obtained using the multi-lead acquisition method, this paper will focus to identify the features of the FECG QRS complex and identifying the abdominal electrode(s) that are feasible to distinguish minor abnormalities with improved FECG acquisition. The indices were derived from the QRS complex focusing on the time intervals and gradients of slopes. The Welch's t-test was performed to identify the significance between the abnormal and healthy conditions. Thereby, the most suitable abdomen electrodes were determined as AI, AIII and AV along with chest electrodes for FECG acquisition. Additionally, newly derived indices have shown the potential of distinguishing the unnoticed minor variations which can be promising diagnostic tools in the early detection of CHDs.","2164-7011","979-8-3503-2363-4","10.1109/ICIIS58898.2023.10253566","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253566","","Electrodes;Heart rate;Pregnancy;Electric potential;Feature extraction;Fetal heart;Biomedical monitoring","","","","25","IEEE","20 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Collecting and annotating diagnostic images like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and X-Ray is a rigorous and time-consuming process. Deep Learning methods are widely utilized for disease classification and prediction from diagnostic images, but they demand substantial amounts of training data. Additionally, certain diseases are uncommon in large patient cohorts, posing difficulties in obtaining sufficient imaging samples to construct accurate deep learning models. Data augmentation techniques are commonly used to overcome this challenge of limited data. These techniques involve applying geometric transformations such as rotation, cropping, zooming, flipping, and other similar operations to the images to enlarge the dataset artificially. Another possible way of expanding the dataset is by synthesizing data to generate artificial medical images by mimicking the original images. This study presents RAD-DCGAN: A Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network to produce high-resolution synthetic radiology images from the X-ray and MRI images collected from a private medical hospital (KMC Hospital, India). We aim to determine the most effective technique for enhancing the performance of radiology image classifiers by comparing and evaluating the proposed RAD-DCGAN with the standard data augmentation strategy. Our empirical evaluation, which involved eight standard deep learning models, demonstrated that deep learning classifiers trained on synthetic radiology data outperformed those trained on standard augmented data. The utilization of the RAD-DCGAN model for training and testing deep learning models on synthetic data has demonstrated a notable improvement of 4-5% in accuracy compared to conventional augmentation techniques. This signifies the state-of-the-art performance achieved by the RAD-DCGAN model in enhancing the accuracy of deep learning models.","2164-7011","979-8-3503-2363-4","10.1109/ICIIS58898.2023.10253599","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253599","Radiology;Synthetic Images;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;X-Ray Images;Deep Learning","Deep learning;Magnetic resonance imaging;Radiology;Data augmentation;Data models;Standards;X-ray imaging","","1","","12","IEEE","20 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, it is important to identify high-quality videos among the videos on YouTube to gain a full advantage of them without wasting time and make predictions of the available videos on YouTube. We identified view count, like count, comment count, caption, number of subscribers, tag count, total views, total videos, avg. polarity score, duration secs, title length, and description length as the main factors to decide the video quality. The purpose of this approach is to suggest seven different classification algorithms to make predictions of the quality/integrity of YouTube videos for users. The collected data set was pre-processed as necessary by cleaning the data groups and removing unnecessary attributes by the attribute ranking. This study was conducted using seven classification algorithms Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Multilayer Perception (MLP), Naive Bayes, and ensemble learning algorithm that combined the five individual algorithms. The model used 60% training data and 40% testing data for the classification by the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) tool. The accuracy of each algorithm, Precision, Recall, and F-Measure are considered and Random Forest is identified as the best individual algorithm with 96.89% testing accuracy and ensemble learning with 97.21% testing accuracy.

Thus, a closed-loop bidirectional multiphase multistage DC-DC converter is proposed, which is also designed to store regenerative braking energy. This can be used to run auxiliary operations, resulting in more effective energy management. IPG CarMaker, a virtual vehicle dynamic software, is used to investigate the performance of the proposed design under dynamic load conditions. This is a safe and less costly approach, which also allows in studying the performance under conditions difficult to test on a prototype. The proposed design is found to perform significantly well and respond quickly to changes in the mode of operation. A good compromise is also achieved between voltage gain and number components under step-up and stepdown operations when compared to other designs in the literature.

Currently, the battery internal temperature monitoring is mainly divided into two situations: normal operation and thermal runaway. The former requires sensors to have relatively high accuracy, while the latter requires sensors to have sufficiently wide temperature measurement range. However, high-accuracy sensors are often accompanied by a narrow temperature measurement range, while sensors with a wide temperature measurement range have relatively low accuracy. This results in the inability of current cell instrumentations to accommodate temperature monitoring across multiple battery states. Our study proposes a novel dual-sensor temperature measurement system that integrates a T-type thermocouple and a K-type thermocouple inside the same commercial cylindrical cell for simultaneous accurate and wide-range temperature sensing, to meet the temperature measurement requirements of different battery applications and scenarios. We found that instrumentation did not adversely affect battery performance. We also compared and quantified the temperature monitoring capabilities of T -type thermocouples and K-type thermocouples in the range of 15–60 °C. The radial temperature gradient collected by the T -type thermocouple was 3.78 °C, which was 0.79 °C higher than that of the K-type thermocouple at the end of 1.4C discharge. The linear relationship between the radial temperature gradient and the discharge rate and ambient temperature obtained from T-type thermocouple has a larger slope than that from K-type thermocouple. During thermal runaway testing, K-type thermocouple could well capture the internal peak temperature without being damaged.","2164-7011","979-8-3503-2363-4","10.1109/ICIIS58898.2023.10253577","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253577","Cell instrumentation;Dual-sensor temperature measurement system;Internal temperature;Radial temperature gradient;Thermal runaway;Lithium-ion battery (LIB)","Temperature measurement;Temperature distribution;Thermal expansion;Instruments;Thermocouples;Sensor systems;Discharges (electric)","","","","16","IEEE","20 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence this research work was carried out to identify the appropriate n-grams, feature representation, preprocessing technique and the machine learning algorithm which suits for the given short text type dataset which can be used as a baseline to compare latest experimented results. We used seven short text types datasets which are publicly available. We compared different n-grams [1-gram,2-gram,3-gram etc], feature representation techniques such as [TF] term frequency and [TF-IDF]term frequency with inverse document frequency techniques as well as the impact of using stop words. Moreover, we compared the classification performances among different traditional machine learning based algorithms. Our conclusions are, combining 1-gram with 2-gram word features gave high performances compared to other n-grams. [2] out of two feature representations techniques TF perform well compared to TF IDF. [3] further, removal of stop word support to improve the classification performances when feature representation type is TF.[4] Moreover, out of traditional machine learning algorithms, SVM gave good results. Finding of our research work can be used to compute baseline classification performances with future research work.","2164-7011","979-8-3503-2363-4","10.1109/ICIIS58898.2023.10253582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253582","n-grams;TF;TF-IDF;pre processing;SVM","Support vector machines;Machine learning algorithms;Social networking (online);Text categorization;Neural networks;Machine learning;Explosives","","","","34","IEEE","20 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In contrast, the concept of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) can be identified as a prospective solution, since the ZTA is designed not to trust any user, device, or entity even if they are within the network perimeter. However, the adaption of ZTA needs an intelligent system to calculate trust, which is a subjective property that machines are yet to understand in comparison to human beings who take decisions based on intuition, gut feelings, emotional responses, etc. Considering the complexity of trust calculation, this work proposes a novel approach based on machine learning (ML) concepts to realize ZTA in a data networking environment. First, it is necessary to calculate the trust value of a certain entity in order to determine the applicable security policies for ZTA. As the trust is based on various attributes, a large traffic dataset collected from a testbed networking environment is fed into several ML models to derive the best suitable trust attributes. Then these attributes are combined using another set of ML models to evaluate the final trust value of an entity in the testbed environment. Further, this work extends the concepts of online learning to integrate continuous monitoring and fine-tuning of trust metrics as required by the ZTA. Finally, the performance of the system is compared and the results indicate that the proposed model outperforms the traditional perimeter-based security model. Furthermore, the study shows the potential of ML-based network security techniques that can be applied in real-world scenarios to efficiently handle large-volume networks and ensure network security.","2164-7011","979-8-3503-2363-4","10.1109/ICIIS58898.2023.10253610","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253610","Data Networks;machine learning;security;trust;zero trust architecture","Network topology;Machine learning;Telecommunication traffic;Standardization;Network security;Real-time systems;Zero Trust","","","","23","IEEE","20 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in short-distance communication systems like Time Division Duplexing Long Term Evolution (TD-LTE) networks, these ducts can cause atmospheric duct interference (ADI). The downlink signals of one base station tend to interfere with the uplink signals of another base station as the electromagnetic waves of the base station travel beyond its planned radius due to atmospheric ducts. This can negatively affect the Quality of Service (QoS) and Service Level Agreements (SLA) in TD-LTE networks. Hence, this work proposes a machine learning-based ADI detection and mitigation methodology that adaptively changes channel parameters to avoid ADI. First, based on the real-world data set, we develop a model to detect ADI in advance. These data are analysed using three mostly cited algorithms in the literature on detecting ADI: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and their performance are analysed to investigate the best feasible model considering the algorithm complexity, real-time capability, accuracy, precision, and recall of the predicted results. The support vector machine shows the highest test accuracy among the three models, with a test accuracy rate of 63.8% in detecting ADI. This performance surpasses the results reported in the literature. In addition, a technique is suggested for mitigating ADI based on the guard period, which refers to the time interval between uplink and downlink signals in the fourth-generation long-term evolution (4G-LTE) network. The proposed method allows for adjusting the guard period based on real-time atmospheric conditions and network-related data, reducing the impact of atmospheric ducting on the network's performance.","2164-7011","979-8-3503-2363-4","10.1109/ICIIS58898.2023.10253504","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253504","Atmospheric duct interference;4G-LTE;TD-LTE;random forest;support vector machine","Support vector machines;Base stations;Machine learning algorithms;Ducts;Terrestrial atmosphere;Quality of service;Interference","","1","","30","IEEE","20 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since they are typically located in harsh external environments, they are exposed to different natural phenomena which cause conductor degradation in mechanisms such as annealing, corrosion, and fretting fatigue. The inability to detect these failures at their rudimentary stages can eventually lead to a loss of reliability of the power system and safety concerns. However, trending inspection methods based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) can be used for effective routine checks of these conductors if the image processing techniques are properly utilized. Therefore, this paper presents a baseline framework for image-based online condition monitoring using RGB and IR images. The competency of extracting macroscopic features from these images is well investigated in this paper, and a foundation is laid to conduct further research that idealizes a more practical alternative for the condition assessment of conductors. Mainly, this work showcases a conductor defect localization and classification method using thresholding and the YOLOv7 algorithm with the aid of an artificially created defect dataset that mimics real-life cases. Moreover, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was applied to perform an age-based classification despite the illuminance level of the moment in which the RGB image was taken. The classifier has been shown to distinguish the three interested classes with an accuracy of 98.5%. In the final stage, thermal image-based analysis was carried out which supports the aforementioned classifier through validation and provides a basis for effectively localizing the corroded areas of a transmission line conductor according to heat dissipation. Further developments in the discussed approaches will advance the power system to a more cost-effective, reliable, and safer state.","2164-7011","979-8-3503-2363-4","10.1109/ICIIS58898.2023.10253531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253531","Condition monitoring;convolutional neural network;thermal image;transmission lines;unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV);YOLOv7","Condition monitoring;Power transmission lines;Thresholding (Imaging);Conductors;Feature extraction;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Thermal conductivity","","","","24","IEEE","20 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Transmitting information with high signal power is exacting on device battery life, therefore an efficient link and network configuration is absolutely crucial to avoid signal power enhancement in interference-rich environment and resorting to battery-life extending strategies. Efficient network configuration can also ensure fulfilment of network performance metrics like throughput, coding rate and spectral efficiency. We formulate a novel approach of first localizing the IoT nodes and then extracting the network topology for information exchange between the nodes (devices, gateway and sinks), such that overall network throughput is maximized. The nodes are localized using noisy measurements of a subset of Euclidean distances between two nodes. Realizable subsets of neighboring devices agree with their own position within the entire network graph through eigenvector synchronization. Using communication global graph-model-based technique, network topology is constructed in terms of transmit power allocation with the aim of maximizing spatial usage and overall network throughput. This topology extraction problem is solved using the concept of linear programming.","2164-7011","979-8-3503-2363-4","10.1109/ICIIS58898.2023.10253499","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253499","Internet-of-Things (IoT);Graph Embedding;Topology Extraction;Eigenvector Synchronization","Network topology;Wearable computers;Logic gates;Throughput;Topology;Internet of Things;Synchronization","","","","25","IEEE","20 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a virtual laboratory, automatic control theory can be verified properly by conducting experiments on models such as coupled tank systems, inverted pendulums, and DC motors. With the remote laboratories, students can access experiments that are not physically available to them at their institutions.

Since Sri Lanka is a developing country, the availability of experimental resources for higher education is considerably low. Hence, some advanced lab experimental setups are not affordable. Therefore, in this research, a cost-effective remote laboratory system has been developed. First, an open-source web-based programming interface is designed. Next, controller analysis tools and virtual lab models are embedded in the web interface. In addition to that, real-time microcontroller programming and monitoring features are enabled in this proposed remote lab system.

This paper proposes an adaptive load shedding technique for two interconnected microgrids in islanded operation that has several distributed energy resources such as solar photovoltaics (PV), diesel generator, and energy storage. The number of load shedding stages, shedding amount in each stage, and tripping time are formulated considering the severity of the disturbance and the state of charge level of the energy storage.

Artisanal fishermen need to keep the catch fresh to sustain a competitive. The main factor affecting the rate of spoilage in fish is temperature. The conventional cooling method stores fish in boxes filled with ice cubes to maintain their freshness. However, it is not efficient, especially with climate change. Even though there is also some onboard system to preserve catches, such as Refrigerated Sea Water (RSW) system. However, RSW storage is too expensive for most of the fishermen due to the high initial price and large energy consumption. The purpose of this research is to propose a sustainable solution to the above-mentioned issues. The researchers created a cost-effective storage device called Solar Cool Box which is a solar-powered fish storage to reduce fishermen's operational costs and improve the quality of the catch. The research method used is a one-shot case study. The device working principle is to convert solar energy into electrical energy, which is then controlled by a charge controller before being stored in the battery. Furthermore, electrical energy from the battery is supplied to the thermoelectric cooler and cools the cooling chamber. The results showed that Solar Cool Box performance was more optimal than the conventional method.

In order to detect the mechanical integrity of power transformer windings, Frequency response measurements (FRA) has been developed. It is an effective tool to detect the internal mechanical integrity. However, interpretation of FRA results can sometimes be tedious when comparing transformers with different structures. This paper presents a FRA measurements based AI approach to recognize different faulty and non-faulty transformers irrespectively of their design structures. FRA data sets were collected from 10, Field aged power transformers with different capacities and each data set consisted of 100 features i.e., 4 FRA frequency bands, 5 FRA measuring methods and 5 statistical analyzing parameters. It was found that with two Principal Components, faulty and non faulty transformers could be easily separated. Accordingly, the 100 features were reduced to 64 features by optimizing FRA measuring methods from 5 to 3. Then different ML techniques and NN algorithms were used to further classify the faulty transformers into three different fault types. It was found that fine kNN was the best method for transformer classification with a 100% accuracy of the tested samples.","2164-7011","979-8-3503-2363-4","10.1109/ICIIS58898.2023.10253506","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253506","Condition Assessment;FRA;AI model;Fault Identification","Power measurement;Windings;Mechanical variables measurement;Frequency measurement;Classification algorithms;Power systems;Power transformers","","","","11","IEEE","20 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, visual-only sensing devices, mainly cameras, have emerged as the primary sensor for obtaining an immersive feeling in autonomous driving. However, the performance of such systems is heavily constrained by fluctuating light intensity and shadows. The primary goal of the presented research is to develop an effective low-light image enhancement system that improves the perception and inter-pretability of images taken in low-light driving environments. The developed image enhancement architecture demonstrates remarkable capabilities, surpassing existing models in terms of real-time suitability, PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) values. Additionally, the model has been specifically designed to have low resource usage, making it an ideal solution for deployment on low-end devices. With significantly lower inference time, the model is exceptionally well-suited for real-time operation in autonomous driving applications. Furthermore, this architecture provides an efficient and effective solution not only for autonomous driving but also for a range of applications in video/image processing and computer vision, such as surveillance systems, medical imaging, astronomy, underwater imaging, and the mining industry. Finally, the relatively short training time makes it an attractive option for researchers and developers.

Smart city concepts rely heavily on real-time data from many systems to operate and would benefit from lower computational power, power to operate, and bandwidth requirements.

Multiple machine learning models were experimented with for vehicle detection where long short term memory neural networks achieved the best result and was used to detect the presence of vehicles. The vehicle trajectory prediction algorithm used the data of the detected vehicles to predict the trajectory using the similarity between records where siamese neural networks with triplet training outperformed other methods.

About 285 million people are visually impaired in the world, as per the WHO. Visually impaired people often face various challenges in their daily lives, particularly when it comes to navigating unfamiliar locations and recognizing unfamiliar objects in their surroundings. State-of-the-art computer vision technologies can be used for assisting visually impaired people. Real-time object detection is a difficult operation as it requires more computing power to recognize objects in real time. SSD (Single Shot multi-box Detection) is a quicker detection method that is suitable for real-time object detection. A lightweight network model is required as the prototype device is tested with a Raspberry Pi microprocessor. Therefore, MobileNetV2 is incorporated with the SSD model to increase the accuracy level of detecting real-time household objects. The developed portable prototype comprises Raspberry Pi 3 model B, a USB camera, earphones, a distance sensor, and rechargeable batteries. The objects captured by the camera are classified by the object detection model and the audio feedback is given to the user through the earphones.","2164-7011","979-8-3503-2363-4","10.1109/ICIIS58898.2023.10253546","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253546","Real-time object detection;SSD;MobileNetV2;Raspberry Pi;Audio feedback","Headphones;Navigation;Face recognition;Computational modeling;Microprocessors;Prototypes;Object detection","","","","13","IEEE","20 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Understanding emotions is an immense challenge for a robot since the emotion are difficult to represent in a quantified domain. Therefore, this paper proposes a method to calculate the intensity level of emotion through machine-learning models and classify user emotions into four categories. The same objective was achieved with four machine learning models, and their performances were analyzed across a variety of parametric evaluations. Finally, the best algorithm that performs well across all the parameters is chosen. The proposed system performs significantly better on test data, with an accuracy of 99.47%. In addition, an experimentation-based study was also held to compare the proposed system's predictions with human participants. The results of the experimental studies reveal that the proposed system's predictions have significant alignment with the data extracted from the responses from the human participants.","2164-7011","979-8-3503-2363-4","10.1109/ICIIS58898.2023.10253609","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253609","Human-Robot Interaction;Emotion intensity;Emotion classification","Training;Emotion recognition;Machine learning algorithms;System performance;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Prediction algorithms","","","","12","IEEE","20 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many of the aforementioned applications are time-critical and require a greater level of precision. Micromouse robot developers have been trying to address the above problems for a long time. However, many challenges still exist, especially in optimizing the time that robot takes to complete a given maze by determining the best travel path. This paper proposes a novel approach to reduce the travel time through a maze of a micromouse using the Floodfill algorithm, Bézier curve interpolation, and trajectory following techniques. Through computer simulations conducted in the Gazebo Simulation environment, the performance of the proposed approach was tested against a conventional Floodfill algorithm-based maze-solving technique. Finally, the proposed approach was tested against other micromouse robots with a range of approaches to solve a maze at the “International Micromouse Challenge - Techfest 2021”, in which the micromouse robot with this proposed approach was ahle to win.","2164-7011","979-8-3503-2363-4","10.1109/ICIIS58898.2023.10253498","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253498","Micromouse;Floodfill;Path planning;Bézier curve interpolation;Autonomous navigation","Interpolation;Navigation;Computer simulation;Medical services;Trajectory;Planning;Time factors","","","","8","IEEE","20 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, the impact on the predicted endmember abundances, when the encoder is trained with decoder guidance, where the decoder's weights are set using different endmember extraction algorithms (EEAs) namely VCA, N-FINDR, PPI and ATGP. Furthermore, a multi-head self-attention layer is introduced to the encoder to capture the spatial correlation of neighboring pixels. After that, the performance with and without the attention layer is examined. These methods are evaluated for two real datasets.

Myocardial Infarction (MI) account for 85% of CVD deaths recorded globally, yet no treatment at present can recover the heart health to its initial condition. Considering CVD statistics, the “Cardio-X” device was developed as a solution to predict an MI. The device comprises a sensory unit - including the III-Lead ECG system, a comparison unit - with the Deep Learning (DL) model: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder and a mobile application for displaying the final result, the condition of the patient. The sensory unit is incorporated in a wearable vest that provides the patient with a comfortable measuring environment. The DL model of the comparison unit runs in a cloud server and is connected to the mobile app through an Application Programming Interface (API). The DL model uses a 5000 dataset of ECGs, including both MI and non-MI patients, comparing the ST-segment elevation of the captured ECGs. Trained and tested with the dataset, the model presents a 97% testing accuracy. Cardio-X is a low-cost solution to address the clinical gap in detecting an MI before its occurrence while significantly reducing mortality and heart damage rates, consequently impacting CVD statistics globally.","2164-7011","979-8-3503-2363-4","10.1109/ICIIS58898.2023.10253510","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253510","Myocardial Infarction (MI);ST Segment Elevation;Deep Learning (DL);Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoder","Heart;Deep learning;Electrocardiography;Myocardium;Predictive models;Mobile applications;Servers","","","","20","IEEE","20 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work presents Endo-MASS, a modular device capable of simultaneously acquiring multiple biosignals, including photoplethysmography (PPG), impedance plethysmography (IPG), peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT), and temperature. Concurrent measurements are obtained from all four modalities at an adequate sampling rate to measure transient changes in vascular function during reactive hyperemia of the forearm. We confirm that Endo-MASS could differentiate healthy and impaired endothelial function from data collected from a cohort of subjects.

Speech impairments will negatively affect all aspects of the life of an individual and reduce its quality. Speech BCI can provide an alternative communication interface for both healthy and speech-impaired individuals. Imagined speech can be used to develop intuitive Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) for subjects with speech impairments. This study focuses on the subject dependency of EEG signals in the context of imagined vowel phoneme classification. Various feature engineering techniques derived from wavelets, statistical analysis, relative wave energy and Hilbert-Huang transforms were studied under both multi-class and binary classifications to compare the results under subject-independent and subject-dependent classifications. Each classification was done using 23 conventional machine learning models with 10-fold cross-validation. The classifications obtained notable accuracies above the chance level for both multi-class and binary classifications. In every scenario, subject-dependent classification had higher accuracies compared to the subject-independent classification. Additionally, the statistical significance of the mean of the results obtained under subject-dependent classification over subject-independent classification was proven under Welch's t-test. Hence, this study provides solid validation that there is a high subject-dependent nature of EEG signals for the task of phoneme imagination.","2164-7011","979-8-3503-2363-4","10.1109/ICIIS58898.2023.10253589","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253589","imagined speech;brain computer interface;elec-troencephalography (EEG);subject-dependency;machine learning;phonemes","Wavelet transforms;Statistical analysis;Machine learning;Wavelet analysis;Solids;Electroencephalography;Brain-computer interfaces","","1","","25","IEEE","20 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
