The production of videos take place in three stages: pre-production, production, and post-production. These three stages consist of script writing, scheduling, logistics, and other administration work. There are commercial products to automate these individual tasks. Incorporating all these software into video production can be expensive and difficult to manage. This study proposes the “Assist” software to handle all processes in video production. It has resulted in a product that covers the three main stages featuring scripts, storyboards, inventory management, production progress tracking and management, and rendering. The mentioned features were designed and developed using decision tree algorithm, PyQt5, general decimation algorithm, mesh simplification algorithm, and multi-variable regression.","","978-1-7281-8412-8","10.1109/ICAC51239.2020.9357162","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9357162","decision-tree;pyqt5;general decimation algorithm;mesh simplification algorithm;linear regression;video production;digital content creation","Software algorithms;Entertainment industry;Production;Rendering (computer graphics);Prediction algorithms;Software;Task analysis","","1","","17","IEEE","26 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It surpasses other conventional learning methods because of ubiquity, mobility, attractive content, facilitated connectivity, and institutional engagements. The main objective of this study is to identify how mobile learning content, higher education institute, and communication technology factors influence learners and teachers when using sustainable mobile learning in higher education. Through the literature review, we developed three separate impact models i.e. mobile learning content, higher education institute, and communication technology with separate impact factors. We used pre and post usage survey questionnaires of 60 teachers and 60 learners to evaluate these models. Primarily, they were asked to fill the pre-usage questionnaire with their initial mobile learning experience. Then, they were allowed to use the modified Moodle mobile app and asked to fill the post-usage questionnaire. The results reveal that the most significant influencing factors are, ease of use in mobile learning content, and facilitating conditions for higher education institutes and communication technology models. Finally, we can conclude that users prefer to have easy to use mobile learning content with better service facilities in higher education institutes and communication technologies.","","978-1-7281-8412-8","10.1109/ICAC51239.2020.9357139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9357139","Mobile learning;Higher education;Mobile base teaching;Teacher perspectives;Learner perspectives","Learning systems;Computational modeling;Bibliographies;Education;Communications technology;Mobile applications;Object recognition","","","","33","IEEE","26 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Mobile applications can be used as a tool to educate the elderly on health management. Hence, the focus on developing health management mobile applications has arisen among the software engineering community as well as the medical experts. Though a considerable amount of health management applications are available online, which some of it are already in use, many still find these application to be less effective and the elderly community is left behind in using them as they don't provide sufficient features preferred by the elderly. Hence, this research focuses on developing a user centered health management application exclusively for the elderly. User requirement related information was collected, and a thorough literature review was conducted with the aim of finding the preferred features needed in the application and the proof of concept prototype was developed.

The global computer animation market size is anticipated to reach USD 28.30 billion by 2025, according to Grand View Research, Inc. Such significant growth demands the tech industry to introduce better tools for making animations. In this paper, we propose our contribution, specifically for User Interface designers in the field of motion graphics. Ul/UX design is found to be one of the top 5 most trending opportunities for motion designers, and our proposed system allows them to generate a 2.5D animation based on a 2D Futuristic User Interface (FUI) design. The ultimate goal is to reduce the production time of FUI animations and minimize the cost of responding to the client's changes. Obtaining clients' feedback directly on animations rather than still images would improve the client's involvement in production, resulting in greater confidence and loyalty. We implement several image processing techniques such as thinning and pixel clustering for pre-processing the 2D designs to segment the given design into an array of atomic shapes. Since the thinned shapes ensure that any pixel in the design does not have adjacent pixels which are also adjacent to each other, it is possible to utilize mathematical means to approximate the shapes. Our system converts a given 2D design to a collection of animated lines and arcs distributed in 3D space that eventually can be exported to the industry-standard tool, Adobe After Effects.","","978-1-7281-8412-8","10.1109/ICAC51239.2020.9357147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9357147","image processing;pixel clustering;thinning;motion graphics;FUI;computational geometry","Industries;Shape;Two dimensional displays;Production;Tools;User interfaces;Animation","","","","28","IEEE","26 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many researches have attempted to mitigate this barrier using Computer Vision based techniques to interpret signs and express them in natural language, empowering deaf and mute people to communicate with hearing people easily. However, most of such researches focus only on interpreting static signs and understanding dynamic signs is not well explored. Understanding dynamic visual content (videos) and translating them into natural language is a challenging problem. Further, because of the differences in sign languages, a system developed for one sign language cannot be directly used to understand another sign language, e.g., a system developed for American Sign Language cannot be used to interpret Sri Lankan Sign Language. In this study, we develop a system called Utalk to interpret static as well as dynamic signs expressed in Sri Lankan Sign Language. The proposed system utilizes Computer Vision and Machine Learning techniques to interpret sings performed by deaf and mute people. Utalk is a mobile application, hence it is non-intrusive and cost-effective. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the our system using a newly collected dataset.","","978-1-7281-8412-8","10.1109/ICAC51239.2020.9357300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9357300","Sinhala Sign Language;Computer Vision;Machine Learning","Computer vision;Assistive technology;Natural languages;Gesture recognition;Machine learning;Mobile applications;Videos","","7","","24","IEEE","26 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a consequence, the non-communicable disease rate has increased dramatically. Amongst these diseases, heart diseases have caused the most catastrophic situations. Apart from the busy lifestyle, studies also show that stress is another factor that causes these diseases. Therefore, the focus of our research is to provide a user-friendly health monitoring system that causes minimum disturbance to its users. However, many studies have focused on predicting health; very few have focused on its usability. The objective of our research is to predict the possibility of cardiac arrests and the presence of stress in real-time using a wearable device prototype. The system uses biometric signals obtained from the photoplethysmogram sensor embedded in the wearable device to perform real-time predictions. We trained three models using random forest, k-nearest neighbor, and logistic regression classification algorithms to predict sudden cardiac arrests with accuracies 99.93%, 99.10%, and 94.47%, respectively. Further, we trained three additional models to predict stress using the same algorithms with accuracies 99.87%, 96.83%, and 65.00%, respectively.

These social media data streams can be used to track and detect different types of outbreaks. A mechanism is needed to identify outbreak-related tweets to predict the outbreak in advance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that can detect tweets related to different outbreaks Epidemics, Public Disorders, and Disasters. GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) embeddings are used as the feature extraction technique as it can capture the semantic meanings of the tweets. Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) which is a specialized Recurrent Neural Network architecture is used as the classification algorithm. In the process, first, outbreak-related tweets were manually collected and curated. Pretrained GloVe word embeddings of 100 dimensions were then used to represent the words of the tweets. As the next step, a Deep Learning Model was trained by using LSTM technique on the curated dataset. Finally, the performance of the model was evaluated using a different dataset. With the results, it can be concluded that the proposed deep learning model is an accurate approach for outbreak-related tweet detection.","","978-1-7281-8412-8","10.1109/ICAC51239.2020.9357274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9357274","outbreak prediction;twitter;word embedding;deep learning;RNN;LSTM;NLP","Deep learning;Epidemics;Recurrent neural networks;Social networking (online);Semantics;Computer architecture;Classification algorithms","","","","21","IEEE","26 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The primary outcome of the model is that the Airline organization can maximize the revenue by controlling the availability. The product in airline industry is the seat, which is an expensive, unstock able product. The demand for the seats is almost uncertain, the capacity is constraint and difficult to increase and the variable costs are very high. Hence the priority of the expected demand forecast is very high for airline industry. An accurate mechanism to predict the revenue for future months of ODs (Origin destinations) is done using fare and passenger data. The revenue is derived by the number of passengers and the fares they pay which vary for each flight. Airline travel is very susceptible to the social, political and economic changes. Therefore, passenger buying patterns change quite dynamically. Hence, it is challenging to develop an accurate method to project the revenue for each route. To overcome this, we are going to use semi-supervised learning mechanism. We have the current ticketed revenue plus we have the current booked passengers. We also have the ticketed passenger details of previous flights. Hence most of the information is available, however changing market conditions is an unknown variable which can have a significant impact on passenger travel patterns. Through this research We are going to design and develop the best fit model to forecast flight OD level passenger demand based on the historical data.","","978-1-7281-8412-8","10.1109/ICAC51239.2020.9357244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9357244","Airline;Prediction;Machine learning;Passenger demand;No-Show Passengers;Average fare;Multivariate regression;Neural network","Industries;Economics;Atmospheric modeling;Organizations;Predictive models;Semisupervised learning;Predictive analytics","","2","","21","IEEE","26 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the usage of IoT devices is increasing in day to day life, the secure data communication in IoT environment is the major challenge. Especially, small sized Single-Board Computers (SBCs) or Microcontrollers devices are widely used to transfer data with another in IoT. Due to the less processing power and storage capabilities, the data acquired from these devices must be transferred very securely in order to avoid some ethical issues. There are many cryptography approaches are applied to transfer data between IoT devices, but there are obvious chances to suspect encrypted messages by eavesdroppers. To add more secure data transfer, steganography mechanism is used to avoid the chances of suspicion as another layer of security. Based on the capabilities of IoT devices, low complexity images are used to hide the data with different hiding algorithms. In this research study, the secret data is encoded through QR code and embedded in low complexity cover images by applying image to image hiding fashion. The encoded image is sent to the receiving device via the network. The receiving device extracts the QR code from image using secret key then decoded the original data. The performance measure of the system is evaluated by the image quality parameters mainly Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Normalized Coefficient (NC) and Security with maintaining the quality of contemporary IoT system. Thus, the proposed method hides the precious information within an image using the properties of QR code and sending it without any suspicion to attacker and competes with the existing methods in terms of providing more secure communication between Microcontroller devices in IoT environment.","","978-1-7281-8412-8","10.1109/ICAC51239.2020.9357260","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9357260","IoT;Steganography;Cryptography;QR code;Microcontroller","Performance evaluation;Image segmentation;PSNR;Microcontrollers;Heuristic algorithms;Complexity theory;Cryptography","","4","","18","IEEE","26 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically, recruiters check Curriculum Vitae (CV), shortlist them and call candidates for interviews which have been the way of recruiting new employees for a long time. To minimize the time spent on the above process, pre-screening mechanisms are nowadays implemented by organizations. However, those mechanisms need sufficient information to evaluate the candidate. For example, in case of a software engineer, the recruiters are interested on the programming ability, academic performance as well as personality traits of potential candidates. In this research, a pre-screening solution is proposed to screen the applicants for the post of Software Engineer where candidates are screen based on an initial call transcript, GitHub profile, LinkedIn profile, CV, Academic transcript and, Recommendation letters. This approach extracts textual features of different dimensions based on Natural Language Processing to identify the Big Five personality traits, CV and GitHub insights, candidate's skills, background, and capabilities from Recommendation letters as well as programming skills and knowledge from Academic transcript and Linked Profile. The results obtained from the different areas are presented and shown that the selected supervised machine learning algorithms and techniques can be used to evaluate the best possible candidates.","","978-1-7281-8412-8","10.1109/ICAC51239.2020.9357279","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9357279","Candidate Selection;Big five personality;GitHub;Recommendation;LinkedIn;Curriculum Vitae;Questionnaire;Academic Transcript;Machine Learning Algorithms","Machine learning algorithms;Organizations;Programming;Feature extraction;Software;Interviews;Software development management","","4","","18","IEEE","26 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this research, we have used the technologies in Semantic Web mainly with the use of the ontology to represent the meaning of the unknown terms in the given high level instruction. If a user has given an instruction in domestic environment as “clean My Room 01 while finding my key for the car” to clean different locations with different capabilities and there can be robot who does not the meaning of the “key”. The robot can get the meaning of the unknown term by communicating with the semantic analyzer which is working with the ontology. According to our analysis we have proved that the object represented by the unknown term can be detected more accurately with compared to existing object detection algorithms since our ontology can represents more concepts related to the given object. The results indicate that if number of unknown terms in the command are increased then the time taken to process the command also be increased.","","978-1-7281-8412-8","10.1109/ICAC51239.2020.9357254","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9357254","Ontology;Robot Operating System;Gazebo;Semantic Web and Algorithm","Semantic Web;Service robots;Semantics;Object detection;Ontologies;Task analysis","","23","","20","IEEE","26 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, ARIMA has shown its success in accuracy and precision in predicting the next time-series lags. As part of the literature, very few studies have focused on Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) to find new predictive approaches for the forecasting of high volatility stock price indexes. Different statistical approaches and economic data strategies have been widely applied to define market price movements and trends and the trade volume levels in CSE over the last ten years.

This research is an attempt to assist the patients in identifying the prescribed medicine information and minimizes misreading errors of medical prescriptions. When a patient uploads the image of a prescription, the system converts it into unstructured text data by using OCR and segmentation, then NER is used to categorize medical information from given text. According to the other research, some solutions exist in other domains for the above mechanisms. But they gave less accuracy when tried to apply for this research due to the domain specialty. Therefore, as a solution to overcome the above discrepancy this approach allows users to scan handwritten medical prescriptions and blood reports and obtain analyzed reports in medical history.

Many factors such as environmental conditions as well as supply, demand, social, cultural, and political situations of the country cause the price of vegetables to fluctuate. Nowadays, social media represents public opinion about current events. Twitter has become one of the fastest social media platforms for getting the latest and historical news and it can be used to track historical trends in different fields. In this paper, we applied the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling algorithm to determine the topics of the tweets about Sri Lanka when the prices of vegetables were very high and low. Through a manual analysis of extracted topics, we identified the situation in the country during a selected period and how it has impacted the vegetable prices. According to the results, vegetable prices are on the rise during the festive season in Sri Lanka. It also appears that political factors, such as elections, do not have a major impact on vegetable prices. It seems that vegetable prices have gone up during the unstable or chaotic periods in Sri Lanka.","","978-1-7281-8412-8","10.1109/ICAC51239.2020.9357264","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9357264","Latent Dirichlet Allocation;Social media Analysis;Text Mining;Topic modeling","Analytical models;Social networking (online);Computational modeling;Voting;Media;Market research;Resource management","","1","","24","IEEE","26 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, a common issue faced in such orchestration technologies is the employment of vast arrays of disjoint monitoring solutions that fail to portray a holistic perspective on the state of microservice deployments, which consequently inhibit the creation of more optimized deployment policies. In response to this issue, this publication proposes the use of a network science-based approach to facilitate the creation of a microservice governance model that incorporates the use of dependency analysis, load prediction, centrality analysis, and resilience evaluation to effectively construct a more holistic perspective on a given microservice deployment. Furthermore, through analysis of the factors mentioned above, the research conducted, then proceeds to create an optimized deployment strategy for the deployment with the aid of a developed optimization algorithm.

There is danger in using internet due to numerous cyber-attacks which are designed to attack Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of systems connected to the internet. One of the most prominent threats to computer networking is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack. They are designed to attack availability of the systems. Many users and ISPs are targeted and affected regularly by these attacks. Even though new protection technologies are continuously proposed, this immense threat continues to grow rapidly. Most of the DDoS attacks are undetectable because they act as legitimate traffic. This situation can be partially overcome by using Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). There are advanced attacks where there is no proper documented way to detect. In this paper authors present a Machine Learning (ML) based DDoS detection mechanism with improved accuracy and low false positive rates. The proposed approach gives inductions based on signatures previously extracted from samples of network traffic.

Automobile industry investing a lot on producing different car models to cater the needs of their customers with different social and economic backgrounds. Thus, Auto makers constantly produce similar car models with different features. In Sri lanka, total number of new vehicles registered at Sri Lanka Registry of Motor Vehicles(RMV) during the period of seven years (from 2008 to 2015) has been increased from 265,199 to 668,907 which is nearly 2.5 times growth. This figure shows the rapid growth of the domestic vehicle market. For a new customer, choosing the most appropriate vehicle requires an extra effort/time and has become a challenging task. For example, matching personal interests and economy with number of available options is a quite complex task. Thus, most of the customers seek support from experts who provide consultancy services. However, customers frequently making complains about the existing services which offers consultancy for new vehicle buyers. The key issues are the people involved in the consultancy are not technically sound and pay minimal attention to customer requirements. Their main focus is to sell the vehicle. Thus, the customers face numerous difficulties before and after buying their vehicle. To address this problem, this research presents a novel vehicle recommender system which guides and gives suggestions to the customers using machine learning technologies. Here, we trained a neural network model using data collected from vehicle users and vehicle sellers. Other than the neural network model, the proposed recommendation system uses natural language processing (NLP) to produce more personalized recommendations. The results shows that the recommendations made by the proposed vehicle recommendation system achieves 96 % accuracy in recommending vehicles.","","978-1-7281-8412-8","10.1109/ICAC51239.2020.9357156","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9357156","Vehicle Recommender systems;Collaborative Filtering;Neural network;Natural Language Processing","Biological system modeling;Neural networks;Natural language processing;Automobiles;Task analysis;Recommender systems;Random forests","","3","","13","IEEE","26 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

IoT devices are constrained by less computing resources and limited battery power. Generally, the TLS/SSL protocol is used to provide communication security on IoT and the protocol utilizes important encryption algorithms like RSA, Elliptic Curve Cryptography, and AES. However, these conventional encryption algorithms are computationally and economically expensive to implement in IoT devices. Lightweight Cryptography (LWC) algorithms were introduced recently for IoT and the aim of the algorithms is to provide the same level security with a minimal amount of computing resources and power. This paper proposes a novel Random Secret Key (RSK) technique to provide an additional security layer for symmetric LWC algorithms for IoT applications. In RSK, IoT devices do not transmit keys over the network; they share a random matrix, calculate their own RSK, encrypt, and transmit the cipher text. When a random matrix lifetime expires new matrix published and RSK resets. Regular change in the RSK makes the IoT networks resistant to brute-force/dictionary attacks. The RSK added one more simple and effective secure layer to strengthen the security of the original secret key and is successfully implemented in a smart greenhouse environment. The outcomes of the experiments prove that the RSK provides enhanced and efficient protection for symmetric LWC algorithms in any IoT systems, consume a minimum amount of resources and more resistant to key-based attacks.","","978-1-7281-8412-8","10.1109/ICAC51239.2020.9357316","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9357316","IoT;Security;LWC;Random Secret Key","Resistance;Technological innovation;Symmetric matrices;Protocols;Green products;Encryption;Internet of Things","","4","","28","IEEE","26 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research introduces a novel approach to infer new ontological knowledge in a fully automated manner. Such ontological knowledge can be utilized in both constructing new ontologies and extending existing ontologies. Basic level triples that can be extracted from open domain text are used as the data source for this study. A simple mechanism has been introduced to convert the triple into an ontological knowledge fact and such ontological knowledge facts are further processed to infer new ontological knowledge. The main focus of this research is to infer new ontological knowledge using an advanced term-clustering mechanism followed by an intra-cluster permutation generation task. Generated permutations are potential to be selected as good ontological knowledge facts. Inferred ontological knowledge was tested with inter-rater agreement method with high reliability and variability. Results demonstrated that, out of 43,103 triples, this method inferred 127,874 ontological knowledge (approximately 3 times) of which 66% were estimated to be effective. Finally, this research contributes a reliable approach which requires a single pass over the corpus of triples to infer a large number of ontological knowledge facts that can be used to construct/extend ontologies.","","978-1-7281-8412-8","10.1109/ICAC51239.2020.9357243","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9357243","Ontology;Triple;Ontological knowledge;Natural Language Processing (NLP);Clustering;word similarity","Knowledge based systems;Sociology;Ontologies;Reliability;Task analysis;Statistics;Testing","","","","18","IEEE","26 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) play a big role in DR detection. Using transfer learning and hyper-parameter tuning DR staging is analyzed through different models. VGG16 gave the highest classification accuracies for the stages Proliferative DR (PDR) & Non-proliferative DR (NPDR). The highest level of NPDR is severe DR which achieved 94.9% classification accuracy (CA) & special features like cotton wool & laser treatment performed at 83.3% CA for each. Moreover, by using patient's history data such as age, right eye & left eye value accuracies & diabetic diagnosed year, system can predict the DR stages. That predictive model has achieved the best CA of 94 % by using Xgboost classifier.

Candidates strive to achieve higher band score in exams, but fail to achieve them due to the ignorance of prevailing weaknesses which have to be identified if they were to succeed. At present, IELTS seems to be the most demanding exam among applicants who are planning to embark their higher studies or migration purposes. Currently, there is no proper mechanism to assist candidates and generate an improvement plan by identifying the weaknesses of them. As a solution, Smart Personal Intelligent Assistant for Candidates Exams (SPIACIE) has been proposed to detect IELTS candidates' weaknesses through an analysis of their answers. The SPIACIE assesses four components (Reading, Writing, Listening, and Speaking) in IELTS exams. This paper is specifically based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network model used to analyze the score of grammar and cohesion. To analyze the similarity of the sentences, the cosine proximity technique is proposed to evaluate the paraphrasing of the graph explanations. The final outcome of this application is to generate an improvement plan, developed using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The proposed algorithms are; Gaussian naïve base for reading exam, support vector machines for listening exam, decision tree classifier for speaking exam, and k-neighbors classifier for writing exam. An improvement plan on the prediction model is provided to increase the band score of the IELTS exams, based on applicants' weakness.","","978-1-7281-8412-8","10.1109/ICAC51239.2020.9357150","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9357150","Long Short-Term Memory;K- Neighbors Classifier;Gaussian Naïve Base;Support Vector Machine;Decision Tree Classifier;Cosine Proximity","Machine learning algorithms;Machine learning;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Grammar;Classification algorithms;Decision trees","","2","","15","IEEE","26 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Mosquitoes that belong to genus Anopheles spread the causative pathogen of malaria. Perfect and speedy species identification is crucial in any surveillance and control strategies. Currently, morphological taxonomic keys are used to identify various species. Two or more primary morphological characteristics, such as a number of dark spots of wings and pale bands of legs, are used in each step of the hierarchical key. To achieve the automatic detection of the primary morphological features, image processing algorithms performed at three levels. At the pre-processing level, methods work with raw, possibly noisy pixel values, with noise reduction and smoothing. In the mid-level, algorithms are utilized pre-processing results for further means with background removing and spots/bands segmentation. At the final level, techniques try to extract the semantics of spots/bands and counting the spots/bands from the information provided.

A simple CNN model was first built and train from scratch by using 22930 tomato leaf images collected from the Plant Village dataset in Kaggle. The model was tested for many cases by changing the values of a set of parameters while keeping other parameters constant. Finally, performance metrics were evaluated for every chosen parameter comparing with the base model. The highest prediction accuracy, training accuracy, and validation accuracy achieved from the study are 92%, 94%, and 92%, respectively.

This research focuses on AI (Artificial Intelligence)-driven smart waste bin that can classify the most widely available solid waste materials namely Metal, Glass, and Plastic. The smart waste bin performs the separation of waste using image processing and machine learning algorithms. The system also performs the continuous monitoring of the collected waste level by using ultrasonic sensors. A dedicated mobile application will generate the optimal routes for the available waste collectors to collect the filled bins. Moreover, with this smart bin, the challenge of recognizing each waste item is overcome by using visual data as the source. Therefore, the usage of expensive sensor devices and filtration techniques to determine the category is disregarded. The smart bin can recognize the category of solid waste, collect it to the specified container, and notify the garbage level in each container.
