Through vishing and smishing, the attackers try to divulge sensitive information over the phone. As some of the common types of vishing and smishing attacks, bank related attacks, insurance related attacks, charity related attacks, social media related attacks can be pointed out. Most of the time these attacks are conducted targeting specific domains that the user is highly vulnerable to. Such as mobile device users have the higher tendency to be susceptible to a scam attack in the domain where they are frequently engaged in. Hence by observing the behavior of the user to a scam attempt, analyzing the user behavior, the vulnerability of the user to a specific scam attack category can be determined. User's behavior in a scam attempt is further influenced by their own characteristics such as socio demographic attributes, behavior related attributes and perceptual related attributes. So the impact of those user characteristics which their behavior in a scam attempt is influenced by plays a significant importance in determining their susceptibility to a scam attempt. Security Education Training and Awareness(SETA) is a program which is commonly available within organizations as preventive mechanisms. The same concept is applied in this proposed solution by creating a knowledge base of SETA recommendations for each category of attack that the user is highly vulnerable to.

Dyscalculia (difficulties in math), dysgraphia (difficulties in writing) and dyslexia (difficulties in reading) can be considered as some of the major learning disability issues. The ‘mobile application based’ solution “Sankalpa Math Master” has been created to offer a game based all-in-one solution including screening, and intervention to identify one of the above-mentioned learning disabilities called ‘Dyscalculia’. Dyscalculia is generally distinguished by challenges in learning math, including organizing problems, multi-step calculations, transposing numbers, distinguishing directions, and understanding mathematical signs, leading to confusion with basic operations and facts. The provided solution has been accurate with the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques. In the process of screening with the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning algorithm 99.77% of accuracy level has been obtained. The skill level prediction process has acquired an accuracy level of 97% with the use of Random Forest machine learning algorithm.

To tackle this, our research revolves around creating a smartphone app that automates and manages physical therapy as part of dementia patients' daily routines. This is achieved through a hybrid machine learning recommendation system. We also conduct a quantitative analysis to gauge the app's assistance level to both dementia patients and caregivers. Insights are gleaned through online surveys and in-person evaluations involving dementia patients, caregivers, and non-demented seniors. This informs the human-computer interaction (HCI) requirements, data collection, and testing phases. It's crucial to note that a controlled user group using the app for a month exhibited a significant improvement ($> 12{\%}$) in engagement with physical therapy compared to their pre-app engagement levels.

With millions affected, the pandemic's magnitude became evident. Even advanced healthcare systems grappled with resource shortages, from protective gear to ventilators. Late diagnosis and the inability to adapt to new SARS-CoV-2 variants led to misdiagnoses and high casualties. Overburdened healthcare facilities and the absence of a centralized patient data system hindered swift decision-making. The lack of real-time monitoring meant many didn't receive timely, personalized care, underscoring the need for an integrated healthcare response during global emergencies. To tackle these challenges and improve hospital resource management during pandemics, this study presents a web approach harnessing big data analytics to develop a machine learning predictive model. This model has been developed to enable hospitals to assess patients' severity in real-time, taking into account a wide range of factors such as symptoms, medical history, and demographics. To acquire data regularly, a streaming data pipeline was established using Apache Kafka and Apache Streaming. In predicting the severity levels of patients, both Multinomial Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models were employed. One noteworthy finding was that using datasets with balanced classes yielded significantly higher accuracy for the MLP model compared to unbalanced datasets. Specifically, MLP achieved the highest accuracy of 60.4% when trained on balanced classes. This model's real-time severity insights have the potential to revolutionize decision-making and resource allocation in healthcare.

Many of the current computer-based air drumming approaches rely on expensive sensors, and their detection accuracies are considerably low. In this study, we have proposed an efficient and real-time air drumming approach that is able to produce the drumming sounds from hand gesture movements. We have collected hand images from a few individuals and then created a hand gesture image dataset. Then the MediaPipe hand gesture model is utilized to extract the hand landmark coordinates. In the next step of the proposed work, a classifier is trained using the hand landmark coordinates to recognize 12 gestures. Finally, the trained classifier is employed to recognize gesture motions and generate the corresponding drum sound and visual feedback for the user.

However, the duration of traffic light cycles remains consistent and equal for all directions with lane control, which causes unnecessary vehicle congestion. In this paper, we propose a model that additionally utilizes an approach to dynamically adjust traffic light schedules in four-way intersections in real-time, taking into consideration variations in traffic density. We have also considered mainly two traffic scenarios, such as light traffic conditions and heavy traffic conditions. In our simulation experiment, it is clearly seen that our proposed approach of dynamically changing the traffic light schedule outperforms conventional traffic control with a fixed time duration.

Recently, brain network measures have been developed for a group of nodes to address brain network analysis problems related to the group context. Group centrality measures are defined for a group of nodes and reflect the importance of the group in transferring information to other nodes. In this paper, we employ group centrality measures to address the inverse query: How can we identify a group of nodes that achieves maximum centrality within a given brain network? This outcome gives rise to an optimal highly central group of nodes referred to as the “Group Hub”. Exhaustive search methods to solve the inverse problem are often infeasible due to their exponential complexity, particularly when navigating extensive permutation search spaces. We introduce a novel algorithm to address this optimal inverse problem, named “Progressive Aggregation for Optimal Node Group Maximization (PANGM)”, which is enhanced through parallel computation. We extensively apply this algorithm to a wide array of structural connectomes from older adults and individuals with Alzheimer's disease.

In this context, CNN's 4096 high-level features of 20,800 images are classified using machine learning algorithms rather than a fully connected layer for classification. Naive Bayes has an average accuracy of 99.9% in the hybrid model. Due to the large number of images required for training the CNN model, this hybrid model is being hand-picked.
