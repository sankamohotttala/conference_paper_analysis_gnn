Most of the time service providers offer a fixed credit limit for customers which may cause customer dissatisfaction and loss of potential revenue. Therefore, it is essential to determine an optimal credit limit that maintains customer satisfaction while stabilizing the company revenue. Clustering algorithms were used to group customers with similar payment and usage behaviors. Then the optimal credit limit derived for each cluster is applicable to all the customers within the cluster. In order to identify the most suitable clustering algorithm, cluster validation statistics namely, Silhouette and Dunn indexes were used in this research. Based on the scores generated from these statistics KMeans algorithm was chosen. Furthermore, the quality of the KMeans clustering was evaluated using Silhouette score and the Elbow method. The optimal number of clusters are identified by those validation statistics. The significance of this approach is that the optimal credit limits generated by these clustering models suit dynamic behaviors of the customer which in turn increases customer satisfaction while contributing to reducing customer churn and potential loss of revenue.","","978-1-7281-4170-1","10.1109/ICAC49085.2019.9103404","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9103404","telecommunication;customer behaviors;machine learning;KMeans Clustering;cluster validation;customer satisfaction;optimal credit limit","Clustering algorithms;Companies;Partitioning algorithms;Indexes;Industries;Feature extraction;Task analysis","","","","13","IEEE","29 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, the volatility framework is used to extract artifacts from the memory dump, and the extracted artifacts are then used to investigate and to identify the malicious processes in the memory dump. The investigation process must be conducted manually, since the volatility framework provides only the artifacts that exist in the memory dump. In this paper, we investigate the four predominant domains of registry, DLL, API calls and network connections in memory forensics to implement the system `Malfore,' which helps automate the entire process of memory forensics. We use the cuckoo sandbox to analyze malware samples and to obtain memory dumps and volatility frameworks to extract artifacts from the memory dump. The finalized dataset was evaluated using several machine learning algorithms, including RNN. The highest accuracy achieved was 98%, and it was reached using a recurrent neural network model, fitted to the data extracted from the DLL artifacts, and 92% accuracy was reached using a recurrent neural network model, fitted to data extracted from the network connection artifacts.","","978-1-7281-4170-1","10.1109/ICAC49085.2019.9103416","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9103416","Memory forensics;malware;cuckoo sandbox;volatility;machine learning;deep learning;feature selection","Malware;Forensics;Random access memory;Microsoft Windows;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Data mining","","4","","18","IEEE","29 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, Advanced Point of Sales (PoS) Systems are widely used in the industry. Regardless of how efficient and secure these systems or applications work, unexpected information security risks can arise. Such risks could be a threat to their business and organization. It is important to ensure that critical information such as payment card information, handled in PoS systems is kept secure from attacks that could bring financial loss. This research provides a solution by studying the overall infrastructure of a PoS System and identifies the key events that such data would be at risk. The major concern of it was to enhance the existing security features of the system to avoid any type of malicious activity. This research consists of four main sections under security related to PoS Systems that would address the risk; Studying of malware and classifying them, detecting possible attacks and means of preventing it, a robot (BOT) to predict and generate the system status with a Data Leakage Prevention(DLP) solution for all the events occurring at a PoS. The key objective of implementing this solution was to protect the confidential data that is being used in the PoS System and to avoid threats that lead to the unavailability of the system. The implemented security features using machine learning and Deep Learning methods to the existing PoS functions produced a 99.3% of accuracy in Malware Detection and 95% of accuracy in its Classification process while the DLP Solution was able to obtain an accuracy of 84.6%. The above results retrieved fulfilled the research objectives and aided to integrate an enhanced security solution for a PoS system.","","978-1-7281-4170-1","10.1109/ICAC49085.2019.9103339","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9103339","Point of Sale Security;Malware Detection;Prevention and Classification;Automated Security Assessments;Data Leakage Prevention;Europay MasterCard and Visa (EMV) payment cards","Security;Trojan horses;Machine learning;Business;Prediction algorithms;Forestry","","","","19","IEEE","29 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But customers are neutral about those messages if they are away from those shops. Therefore, the authors decided to implement a mobile application to send location-based sales offer notifications to customers in order to overcome this problem, with some additional features. The main features in the proposed system are to filter out sales offer details from social media, send location-based notifications containing details of offers to customers, provide personalized search predictions during search, and provide recommendations to merchants to improve their business. Modern technologies like Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are used to build the solution for this problem. The main advantage of the proposed system is that customers are attracted more towards the sales offers since they receive them when they are close by to the relevant shop. Also, merchants can reach targeted customers resulting in a more effective marketing campaign. The survey conducted proved that both customers and merchants are highly satisfied with the effectiveness of the product.","","978-1-7281-4170-1","10.1109/ICAC49085.2019.9103347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9103347","Machine Learning;Natural Language Processing;Text Extraction;Recommendations;Search Predictions;Review Analysis","Mobile applications;Global Positioning System;Business;Facebook;Filtering;Natural language processing","","","","20","IEEE","29 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By the year 2045, this is expected to rise to 156 million. Lack of a permanent cure and impractical, expensive, painful measuring techniques are among the reasons behind these alarming statistics. Almost 58% of diabetes patients are not diagnosed in this South Asian region, mainly due to lack of motivation caused by the above issues. This research focuses on finding a solution, which is non-invasive, portable, practical, accurate, and cost-effective with the help of sensors and accessible technology platforms. The research started upon discovering the medical classifications, parameters, contributing factors, and external dynamics that could affect the result. Upon research, an algorithm was developed to calibrate and measure the blood glucose level, which is compatible with dynamic factors of the patients. Later on, the hardware device was built using NIR and red LEDs accompanied by a user-friendly mobile application, which can be accessible by patients of all ages. The results obtained were validated by using statistical techniques. The analysis showed a strong linear correlation between the voltage output and blood glucose level. The overall accuracy of the system accounts for above 90%. Since this solution is noninvasive, it provides a reusable and portable platform which can constantly monitor blood glucose levels conveniently in a painless manner, without any repetitive costs.

Learning disabilities are neurological disorders that affect the brain. Children with learning disabilities have trouble with learning compared to their fellow peers and quite often fall back academically since a majority of them go undiagnosed. The specific learning disabilities for which this paper provides screening are dyslexia a reading disability, dyscalculia a mathematical disability, letter dysgraphia and numeric dysgraphia are both writing disabilities. Deep learning and machine learning techniques are used in the screening process of these specific learning disabilities. Trained convolutional neural networks are used to detect the spoken letter/word, detect the written letter/word and detect the written number on the mobile application. Outputs from the convolutional neural network are fed into the models used for screening learning disabilities. The machine learning algorithms used in building the models include k-nearest neighbors, random forest and support vector machine. Screening results from the models built in this research provided an accuracy of 89%, 90%, 92%, 92% for dyslexia, letter dysgraphia, dyscalculia and numeric dysgraphia respectively.

There are several approaches available for driver gene prediction, but methodical ways to combine and optimize the existing algorithms for more massive datasets are few. This approach formulates an effective method to identify potential cancer driver genes by identifying the drawbacks of existing identification methods of cancer driver genes. The newly proposed hybrid pipeline (Dots Witer) summarizes the somatic mutations and genes involved in tumorigenesis. The pan-cancer dataset consists of 2397 small somatic variants related to Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA), and a 1017 data sample of Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) has been selected as a dataset for testing the proposed approach. The Dots Witer pipeline can be applied to genes that are targeted by Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) and small insertions and/or deletions (indels). The Dots Witer pipeline has been implemented by integrating DOTS-Finder and WITER to identify the driver genes efficiently and accurately. The proposed pipeline identified 65 cancer progression genes, and among those, 32 were tested and confirmed by Cancer Gene Census (CGC) related to BRCA. Moreover, the Dots Witer identified 43 cancer progression genes and 29 were verified and confirmed by CGC related to LUAD. The Dot Witer pipeline gives a higher fraction of predicted driver gene set compared to other existing pipelines.","","978-1-7281-4170-1","10.1109/ICAC49085.2019.9103401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9103401","driver genes;somatic variants;SNVs;indels;exome/genome sequence","Cancer;Pipelines;Tools;Prediction algorithms;Genomics;Tumors;Lung","","","","13","IEEE","29 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Basically, the system interprets the commands with uncertain words, into a machine understandable format. According to the literature review, human-robot association does not go with uncertain words and it is a considerable gap. This proposed system has a client side mobile application to input voice. To build a machine understandable command, it refers to an ontology based knowledge store. The knowledge store gains information and expands its knowledge by crawling websites. Once the user commands, the drone to make a movement, the system will analyze the instruction to check if there is uncertainty and if it points to a surrounding object that is visible to the drone's camera.

In our research work we have introduced a further developed method to localize optic disc more accurately. We have not limited our research to one channel of the retinal image but we have compared the results obtained by taking red and green channels of the retinal images separately for the optic disc localization. Finally our research introduced a novel method for the optic disc localization by using both red and green channels without limiting the research to one channel only. The proposed technique has a overall accuracy of 92.52% which is considerably high compared with analysis done using red and green channels of retinal image separately.","","978-1-7281-4170-1","10.1109/ICAC49085.2019.9103394","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9103394","optic disc;retinal images;morphological closing;morphological dilation","Optical imaging;Retina;Optical sensors;Adaptive optics;Diseases;Histograms","","","","15","IEEE","29 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Film industry majors say that this happens because not enough local movies are made within the country by local artists. Therefore, there is no problem with the number of creative minds in the country. The reason for the lack of local movies made annually in the country is because it takes a lot of effort, time and money. And if the movie fails, millions get wasted. Movies mostly fail because they are not organized very well from the beginning. Everything starting from the script to the final tickets that are going to be sold needs to be planned during pre-production. If pre-production fails, production fails. If production fails, post-production fails. The success or the failure of a movie starts right at the beginning of the pre-production phase. This phase contains many processes that are very important to carry out the production phase. One of them is location scouting. Since film industry is mostly based on aesthetic pleasure of the people in the society, scenic beauty is a must when choosing locations for a movie. “Film-it” is an application that is capable of giving all kinds of assistance in location scouting and much more in movie planning. That is the reason it is called “The Virtual Location Scout and Movie Production Planning Assistant”.

Fundamental mechanisms for how a listener perceives emotions in music as well as the way in which the emotional goal of a composer is expressed through music have been widely explored. Not only humans but also machines can recognize emotions in music once they are trained. As a result, various machine learning approaches are tested by previous researchers for their capability in music emotion recognition. To identify the current status of research and the research gaps in the above domain, we conducted a systematic literature review, through which we investigated several key aspects including types of music, acoustic features, feature extraction mechanisms, classification algorithms, and their performance. Six electronic databases were searched for studies published until 2018. Initial set of studies comprised of 198 studies from which 14 were selected for detailed analysis. Findings revealed that a considerable number of studies have used western music whereas other cultural-specific music still remains to be explored. Acoustic features pertaining to pitch, intensity, timbre, tempo, rhythm, melody, and harmony have been commonly used. While Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and k-Nearest Neighbor are among the frequently used standard classifiers, Fuzzy classifiers and ensemble learning also have been attempted. The discrepancies among the classifier performances reported in previous studies could be partially attributed to the differences in the key aspects we have considered. The study makes a significant contribution by providing a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the previous attempts made in the selected domain.","","978-1-7281-4170-1","10.1109/ICAC49085.2019.9103378","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9103378","music emotion;music emotion classification;machine learning;systematic literature review","Music;Databases;Machine learning;Bibliographies;Systematics;Emotion recognition;Feature extraction","","4","","24","IEEE","29 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, it is significant to extract this registry information to simplify the investigations for forensic professionals. At present, tools are limited to few commonly used registry information and there is a much border area to cover. Investigators have to manually search for the registries for required artifacts. But the nature and complexity of the registry file structure limits most of the investigators using these registries. Limiting this registry analysis only to the physical registry files and not considering the ability of extraction of registry information from Volatile Memory is another significant issue in registry forensics. Because these tools are only rely on the physical registry files and cannot extract registry artifacts from Volatile Memory.

One of the most pressing concerns in modern days is the security of credentials. As a solution, developers have introduced the multifactor authentication. The multi-factor authentication has an adverse effect on user experience. This paper proposes a novel adaptive authentication mechanism which tries to eradicate the negative user experience of the traditional multi factor authentication systems. Adaptive authentication gathers information about each user and prevents fraudulent attempts by validating them against the created profiles. This approach will increase the usability, user-friendliness by introducing multi-factor authentication only when its necessary using a risk based adaptive approach. Furthermore, the solution ensures security by authenticating the legitimate user through collectively analyzing the properties, behavior, device and network related information. In the creation of the user profile, the adaptive authentication system will gather and analyze the user typing behaviors using a unique recurrent neural network algorithm named LSTMs with 95.55% accuracy and mouse behaviors using SVMs with 95.48% accuracy. In device-based authentication, a fingerprint is generated to the browser and to the mobile device which is utilized in the analysis of the accuracy rate of the authentication. Blacklisting and whitelisting of the networks and geo velocity of the authentication request are captured under the geolocation and network-based authentication. All the accuracy rates are fed to the risk-based authentication which helps the decision of re-authentication or in the grant of access to the system by analyzing the risk score generated for the authentication request.","","978-1-7281-4170-1","10.1109/ICAC49085.2019.9103382","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9103382","RNN;LSTMs;SVM;Naive-Bayesian;Authentication","Authentication;Mice;Adaptive systems;Mobile handsets;Servers;Support vector machines","","2","","31","IEEE","29 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Usually, the body splits down the sugars and carbohydrates you eat into a sugar called glucose. Glucose fuels the cells in the body. But the cells require insulin, a hormone, in the bloodstream to get in the glucose and utilize it for energy. Body doesn't make enough insulin, or it can't use the insulin it produces are the two main reasons to occur diabetes. Since the cells can't take in the glucose, it forms up in the blood. High levels of blood glucose can ultimately create nerve injury to the tissues in the extremities. The damage to nerves is a significant reason to occur foot ulcers. If a diabetic sufferer has foot ulcers, he/she need to manage it. Unless with the time they can drop their sensation in the foot which is known as neuropathy situation, which eventually appears in foot ulcers. Because of this, doctors advise using a diabetic shoe to prevent foot ulcers. These shoes decrease the peak plantar force exerted on the foot, but temperature, humidity and abnormal pressure are not managed, and this can be effective on the infection of wounds. As Diabetes is the main reason for the occurrence of these foot ulcers, maintaining blood glucose level is important. Diabetic patients can manage their blood glucose level by controlling daily calorie consumption and activities. For this self-maintenance of diabetes, patients should reduce their blood glucose level periodically and get notified of its divergence. The concept “Día shoe” proposed is an innovative mobile base plug and play device which can be attached to any sort of diabetic shoe to manage the foot ulcers and prevent them from spoiling, while monitoring temperature, humidity, weight and step count of the patient through a mobile application.","","978-1-7281-4170-1","10.1109/ICAC49085.2019.9103408","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9103408","Linear Regression;Machine learning;Diabetes Mellitus","Diabetes;Foot;Temperature measurement;Sugar;Humidity;Footwear;Biomedical monitoring","","9","","16","IEEE","29 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

VAULT makes use of individual idle storage space on a network of peer-to-peer nodes which is then provided to an end user to store files in the pooled space. VAULT implements redundancy by the use of Reed-Solomon codes and maps file fragment locations using a blockchain as a distributed ledger. Fragment distribution is optimized using a machine learning approach where node characteristics are used to determine the reliability of each node. The aggregation of above features makes VAULT an ideal solution for corporate environments where consumer hardware and infrastructure is already allocated.","","978-1-7281-4170-1","10.1109/ICAC49085.2019.9103371","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9103371","Reed-Solomon;distributed-ledger;peer-to-peer;distributed-storage;Merkele-trees","Peer-to-peer computing;Reed-Solomon codes;Cryptography;Data structures;Redundancy","","1","","9","IEEE","29 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, despite such benefits, they have a tendency to be lengthy and tedious to watch. They also prove cumbersome when precise information needs to be extracted from the content. Another drawback is that recorded lecture videos fail to show the connection between the lecture and its support material such as slides and questionnaires. Though many of the existing platforms allow editing lecture videos for more interactivity, the methods employed by these platforms have always been manual, and therefore time intensive. VTutor is a web platform that aims to address these drawbacks by introducing automation into the video enhancement process, eventually combining the lecture material to create an enhanced user experience. Specifically, VTutor allows users to navigate through a lecture video using subtopics, its corresponding slides and code samples. Furthermore, it is equipped with the ability to automatically generate questions by scraping the internet based on provided keywords thus improving the level of engagement that a learner has with the lecture.","","978-1-7281-4170-1","10.1109/ICAC49085.2019.9103406","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9103406","E-Learning;Recorded Lectures;OCR;Topic Based Video Segmentation;Question Generation;Text Extraction;Code matching;Slide matching","Videos;Encyclopedias;Electronic publishing;Internet;Synchronization;Classification algorithms","","","","24","IEEE","29 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since most of the farmers have a lack of knowledge about soil nutrients, they start cultivations by believing myths in society and few of them use scientific approaches. This research mainly focuses on suggesting the best crop according to soil fertility of land and also it recommends a fertilizer plan to optimize the amount of fertilizers applied for suggested crops. The paper presents a tool with embedded sensors that measure soil fertility and developed a cross- platform mobile application to suggest the best crops according to available soil fertility. Further, a fertilizer plan will be suggested to optimize fertilizer usage in order to increase profitability and avoid soil degradation.
