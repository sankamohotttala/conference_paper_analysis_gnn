In the beginning phase of this digital advertising, multiple advertisements were displayed on the users’ feeds, including advertisements despite their preferences. This was a terrible user experience for the users. However, smart advertising based on customer preferences can manage the flow of advertisements on the feed as per the users’ preferences. This same technique can be used in handling advertisements while shopping at supermarkets. These advertisements can be directed based on demographic characteristics like face and gender and previous customer transactions. Additionally, providing the nearest supermarket they can reach based on their current location. Queue management is the next most crucial facility that needs to be provided to a supermarket. However, the manual system of queue management is not effective. But with a modernized queue management system, overcrowded supermarkets can be managed effectively. This proposed system also considers providing a chatbot service to manage customer inquiries in a reliable strategy. In this system, we mainly used the Keras model called VGGFace for face detection, the Conventional Neural Network and Keras-based model for gender detection, the TensorFlow model called Single Shot MultiBox Detection MobileNet for queue and crowd detection, the Apriori algorithm base model for predicting the buying pattern, a Keras-based model for Artificial Intelligence chatbot and finally, google map Application Programming Interface for the nearest supermarket finding are models and technology. This system was developed to manage a supermarket properly.","","979-8-3503-9809-0","10.1109/ICAC57685.2022.10025117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10025117","smart advertising;manage supermarkets;customer preferences;queue management;hotspot analysis;and crowded area.","Neural networks;Manuals;Predictive models;Developing countries;Chatbots;Prediction algorithms;User experience","","","","25","IEEE","31 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The All-Island Farmers Federation (AIFF) claims that post-harvest produce loss is a problem that has plagued farmers in all regions of Sri Lanka and occurs both on farms and in commercial locations. The lack of a suitable system to handle produce, such as fruits and vegetables, has been identified as the key problem. The process of sowing seeds to generating the harvest and transporting it to the consumers is an overly complex process. If this process is not correctly identified the demand and supply may not be at equilibrium. Farmers tend to take decisions based on their experiences or from the knowledge gathered from past generations. Over the year environmental factors as well as economic factors have changed, therefore there is a high chance that the decisions taken by farmers might lead to wastage of crops. This research hopes to produce a mobile application for the farmers by considering some factors that affect the wastage in crops and try to provide timely relevant information to minimize the crop wastage by deploying machine learning, one of the advanced technologies in crop prediction.","","979-8-3503-9809-0","10.1109/ICAC57685.2022.10025261","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10025261","Mobile Application;Neural networks;Simple Linear programming;Machine learning;Support Vector Machine;Prediction","Support vector machines;Economics;Machine learning;Environmental factors;Agriculture;Seeds (agriculture);Mobile applications","","","","13","IEEE","31 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The step-by-step process discussed in this study is further demonstrated with the creation of a synthetic voice for the Sinhala language, with unit selection as the voice building approach. A Sinhalese voice was generated with an intelligibility score of 91.7% upon evaluation with Diagnostic Rhyme Test (DRT). Comparison with ground truth data proved a close approximation to human speech where the intelligibility score was identified as 97.9%, when tested with the same participants.

However, tourists face various inconveniences due to the obsolescence of facilities. There are various tools designed to solve such problems. But they are scattered in different places and users have to use different tools. The biggest issue in the tourist sector is that travelers are unable to get the most out of their tours since there may be days when a large number of people visit the same location, causing the location to become overcrowded, and preventing tourists from enjoying their visit as anticipated. There are seasons when natural disasters occur, as well as human-centered crises. Also, there are situations when travelers feel helpless because they are unable to find the best tour guide for them. We developed a cost-effective, automatic, and efficient Machine Learning-based recommendation system as a result of this research. Based on past data on tourists and data received from the SLTDA, this research can provide the best trip plan with the tour guide and provide destination news alerts on regular basis.

The pandemic has revealed the limitations of existing digital healthcare systems to manage public health emergencies. There is no registered population for many healthcare institutions in Sri Lanka, as a result, there is a communication gap. Electronic Health Record systems (EHRs) are becoming popular to share patient details but accessing scattered data across several EHRs while safeguarding patient privacy remains a challenge. Most of these medical records are in printed format and manually entering those into EHR systems is time-consuming and error prone. Not only that pharmaceutical error is a critical healthcare problem, but it is even riskier to visit doctors for pharmaceutical diagnosis during a pandemic. This research introduces a Blockchain-based patient health record system, an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) based Medical Document Scanner, a Drug Identifier based on Image Processing and a Medical Chatbot powered by NLP as four novel approaches to address these issues.

In particular, we consider how they build their team, how they position themselves in their positions, how they work with teams, how they face obstacles along the way, and how to move groups out of control in an emergency. We use a leader-follower strategy here, and we are also tasked with selecting a leader for each group. The leader finds the shortest route to avoid the obstacle by considering the obstacle details such as obstacle location, obstacle width, and destination. The leader decides the best way for the team to go. If the leader wants to change the group, it gives the message to the relevant member. In the event of meeting an obstacle, it changes its shape and moves. A Robot Operating System (ROS) framework was created to perform real-time experiments with ROS-capable mobile robotic TURTLEBOTs to evaluate this control strategy. Simulations performed on a mobile robot team demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","","979-8-3503-9809-0","10.1109/ICAC57685.2022.10025255","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10025255","ROS;Mobile Robot;Homogeneous;Multi-Robot;Formation","Smart cities;Shape;Operating systems;Computational modeling;Multitasking;Real-time systems;Cleaning","","","","25","IEEE","31 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, infrastructure configuration and management of resources are still challenging due to the disjointed nature of the infrastructure and resource management tools’ failure to comprehend the deployed applications and create a holistic view of the services. This is partly due to the extensive knowledge required to operate these tools or due to the inability to perform specific tasks. As a result, multiple tools and platforms need to conFigure together to automate the deployment, monitoring and management processes to provide the optimal deployment strategy for the applications. In response to this issue, this research proposes an expert system that creates a centralized approach to cluster autoscaling and resource management, which also provides an automated low-latency container management system and resiliency evaluation for dynamic systems.

Here we identified four main problems. First, it was wrong crop cultivation. This is the main reason crops and cultivation are destroyed. To give a solution to that problem, we suggest the five most suitable crops to cultivate according to their location. The second problem is a lack of knowledge about future market prices. As a solution to that problem, we predict prices for each cop for the next 12 months. Another problem is an inability to sell their product at a reasonable price. Here, we directly connect buyers and sellers by removing intermediaries. The last problem is the difficulty to identify diseases affected by crops.

In this study, the system primarily evaluates the efficiency of workers and, through the detection of their emotional states, determines their levels of motivation. The task completion rate of employees is measured by the system in the first component, and the system predicts the level of satisfaction that the employees will have. In place of linear regression, this component makes use of random forest regression, which boasts a higher degree of precision than its counterpart. The performance of workers on their tasks will be evaluated periodically, about once every fifteen minutes, and the results will be shown on a dashboard. The system will pick up on the emotions of the staff members throughout the second phase of the process. These characteristics will be used to assess the level of motivation inside the organization, with the end goal of increasing overall productivity. The accuracy of this emotion detection will also be checked periodically, namely once every fifteen minutes. The following part of the process monitors the use of the PC and calculates the level of productivity. It will be possible to get an increase in productivity if one monitors and keeps track of the application usage of each employee. The final components monitor the websites that employees visit and how they use the network. This component makes it easier to generate reports based on the utilization of the internet and the network, as well as information on performance and reports that summarize website traffic.

Lithic archeology’s study of stone tools provides important information about early humans’ technologies, agility, and mental and innovative abilities. A vital issue in lithic archeology is the identification and analysis of stone tools found at the excavation sites. Archeologists need to observe and analyze a stone tool under different aspects for a long time to verify whether it is a stone tool or a geofact, the techniques used to create it, and identify its rough relative date and functional value. This can be challenging for amateur scholars studying archeology since it requires a lot of experience and time to identify by a glance. As a solution, ‘Stonelia,’ a mobile-based android application, can be introduced to identify and analyze stone tools. The images captured through the mobile app are preprocessed using image processing. Using Convolutional Neural Network models identifies the stone artifact from a geofact, the mineral type, the rough relative date, techniques used to create the stone artifact, and its functional value.

The proposed system which is based on IoT technology and MQTT protocol can set optimal growth conditions for plant and seed growth within the greenhouse. The sensor-based inputs are to be transformed into the processed values based on the defined logic and the standard benchmarks gathered from the local agricultural authorities. The key areas of condition monitoring to be done via temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and lighting can ultimately yield an increased harvest having supported both the plant and seeds-based implementations for multiple types of plants. One of the most important factors to consider is that the farmers can have energy savings through the proposed solution by controlling the actuators in an optimal manner and reducing manual intervention by a considerable amount. The excess usage of electricity by lights and cooling fan usage in the greenhouse can be controlled with real-time data tracking and better analytics. The use of water can be properly maintained for the plants by putting only the required amount will make the soil wet and spraying the required amount to air will make better humidity control. Thus, the real-time condition-based controlling of the actuators leads to making the greenhouse operations more optimal and better utilization of resources and energy which ultimately results in financial benefits for the greenhouse owner. Based on the evaluated power consumption of the greenhouse power usage before and after the system was installed, the newly introduced system can save energy by having optimal control of actuators by performing algorithmic calculations to meet only the required level of weather conditions. This is to be proven experimentally by implementing the proposed system for a defined period of time under the monitoring of energy usage.","","979-8-3503-9809-0","10.1109/ICAC57685.2022.10025101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10025101","energy;greenhouse;efficiency;accuracy;power consumption","Temperature sensors;Actuators;Automation;Temperature;Green products;Manuals;Benchmark testing","","","","18","IEEE","31 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, applying natural language processing to low-resource languages is challenging due to their lack of digital presence. Sinhala is the native language of approximately nineteen million people in Sri Lanka and is one of many low-resource languages. Moreover, the increase in using code-switching: alternating two or more languages within the same conversation, and code-mixing: the practice of representing words of a language using characters of another language, has become another major issue when processing natural languages. Apart from natural language processing, the explainability of opaque machine learning models utilized in chatbots has become another prominent concern. None of the existing modern chatbot development platforms supports explainability and relies on a performance score such as accuracy or f1-score. This paper proposes a no-code chatbot development platform with a series of built-in novel natural language processing, model evaluation, and explainability tools to tackle the problems of processing Sinhala-English code-switching and code-mixing natural language data and model evaluation in modern chatbot development platforms.","","979-8-3503-9809-0","10.1109/ICAC57685.2022.10025153","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10025153","Chatbots;Natural Language Processing;Code-switching;Code-mixing;Explainability","Training data;Machine learning;Oral communication;Chatbots;Data processing;Data models;Indexes","","","","24","IEEE","31 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consumption data of individual appliances as opposed to the entire house are therefore in high demand. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is a way of producing individual appliance consumption data without using meters at individual appliances. Most studies have used signal features in steady state for device identification. However, many studies have not explored transient state signal characteristics for NILM. The voltage-current (V-I) trajectories during the transient state provide a unique way of representing the energy consumption of appliances. Although appliance-vise V-I characteristics have been considered in past studies, none has used aggregate V-I characteristics for appliance classification. Hence, using the V-I features of the aggregate data in an innovative manner for appliance classification has been explored in this work. The publicly available Plug-Level Appliance Identification Dataset (PLAID) was used to conduct this work. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been designed for device identification with 3 convolutional layers, a flatten layer and 4 fully connected layers. The results confirmed the possibility of using aggregate V-I trajectories for appliance classification with accuracies of up to 92% while retaining the full non-intrusive flavor of the study.","","979-8-3503-9809-0","10.1109/ICAC57685.2022.10025280","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10025280","Aggregate;Classification;CNN;Load monitoring;Non-intrusive;V-I trajectories","Training;Load monitoring;Energy consumption;Data aggregation;Data models;Trajectory;Windows","","","","21","IEEE","31 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Intervention at a young age facilitates the training and enhancement of attention, as young brains are the most responsive to treatment. Sri Lanka, a low-income country, lacks accessible, home-based screening tools which can be used to assess the attention of young children. Moreover, most Sri Lankan parents are not aware of attention impairments. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes an easily accessible, home-based attention assessment tool in the form of a mobile application. The application provides a series of engaging tasks for assessing and training, the aspects of visual attention (focused attention, selective attention, divided attention, sustained attention and shifting attention). The assessments were carefully designed to suit the age and the attention span of the child. The performance analysis performed on the data collected showed the varied responses of children of different ages on different assessments. Clustering was performed in identifying the varying performance levels of typical children and this project will be extended to evaluate atypical child performance.","","979-8-3503-9809-0","10.1109/ICAC57685.2022.10025144","Ministry of Higher Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10025144","attention assessment;focused attention;selective attention;divided attention;sustained attention;shifting attention;child attention","Training;Bridges;Visualization;Performance analysis;Mobile applications;Task analysis","","","","13","IEEE","31 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fear of speaking in public is commonly called “glossophobia,” where people are discouraged from speaking in front of people due to embarrassment and rejection. Public speaking anxiety (PSA) is one of the most universal subtypes of anxiety where people fear, lose their confidence, and become uncomfortable physically and mentally. But public speaking is considered important in the educational sector and workplaces, where people get higher opportunities. Therefore, clubs like Toastmasters help people overcome their fear of public speaking and improve their confidence. We are launching the idea of a Smart Monitoring and Reporting Toastmasters System for people to improve their public speaking so they do not need a supervisor or mentor to train them. This smart monitoring system recognizes the candidate through image processing and deep learning. Moreover, this will analyze some features from the candidates’ speeches, such as facial emotion recognition, speech recognition, hand and body gesture recognition, and the candidates’ attire and appearance separately. This system will identify their mistakes and flaws and provide overall feedback to the users on the speech provided by the candidate. By implementing this web application, users can train themselves without a supervisor, and they can improve themselves and gain the confidence to participate in a Toastmasters competition as perfect candidates.","","979-8-3503-9809-0","10.1109/ICAC57685.2022.10025147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10025147","Toastmasters;glossophobia;speech recognition;facial emotion recognition;body gesture recognition;appearance analysis","Emotion recognition;Image recognition;Social networking (online);Anxiety disorders;Speech recognition;Organizations;Public speaking","","","","16","IEEE","31 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

People must take into account a number of factors before purchasing a specific automobile. Some of crucial factors are service costs and future market prices. Ordinary people require the assistance of a professional when estimating the market price of a car and calculating the cost of servicing a car. Accidents can also occur at any time when driving a car often. In similar circumstances, consumers require the assistance of an insurance agent or a technician to estimate the cost of damage repair. In this study, we provide a way for non-automotive experts to use their smartphones to identify car models, forecast future market prices, determine and forecast servicing costs, and estimate minor damage repair costs.

However, such techniques are rarely used in Sri Lankan agricultural industry. The success of agriculture depends heavily on the selection of the right crop. Choosing the right crop depends primarily on predicting future yields. Machine learning methods can be used very successfully to make future predictions about crop yields. Crop prediction mainly depends on the soil, geography, and climate of the growing location. Hence historical data with agricultural facts such as temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall are used to predict yield as parameters in the machine learning function. Sri Lanka uses a traditional approach to distribute fertilizers among farmers. Not having an organized way to distribute fertilizers to the needed areas leads to many abnormalities along the way. As a result, the country is facing economic losses and resource wastage. Having an optimized distribution network is the key to overcoming those abnormalities. This research assesses the efficiency of the fertilizer distribution system and consists of time-series predictions on fertilizer usage to gain future value. The aim is to identify performance gaps in distribution management that lead to delayed fertilizer distribution affecting agricultural productivity.","","979-8-3503-9809-0","10.1109/ICAC57685.2022.10025182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10025182","Fertilizer;crop;prediction;machine learning;optimization","Productivity;Temperature distribution;Systematics;Crops;Machine learning;Humidity;Soil","","1","","13","IEEE","31 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These transactions rely on handwritten signatures, an unreliable methodology for determining an asset’s ownership. The legal system governs this process. However, several disputes have occurred due to improper validation and verification when registering properties, changing custody, and maintaining the chain of ownership. Trades have been made by including a lower value than the actual asset value, which will reduce the tax owed to the government and will lead to the failure of these departments. There are no appropriate mechanisms to resolve common disputes that arise within the domain. The courts must resolve these disputes using the same recurring traditional procedure, which will take years or decades to conclude. The main objective of this research is to develop a secure property registration mechanism by creating a digital protocol using a decentralized blockchain network.

In Sri Lanka, a developing country, it is difficult to find resources such as clinics, clinical expertise, and other resources which are essential for diagnosis. The absence of these apparatuses risks the mental well-being of the child as well as access to help. Hence a need arises to develop an automated social attention evaluation system. This will serve as the first line of diagnosis and help the parents/guardians secure the help required from an early age for the child.

Keeping the low-income bracket of the country in mind, we propose a solution that can be easily deployed even on a cheap mobile/tablet-like device. It is difficult to perform these evaluations for children in similar settings as adults, as they are easily distracted. Therefore, care must be taken to grab the child’s attention throughout the evaluation process. In this research, we developed applications for children at different levels and each level assesses child attention between social objects and non-social objects through a child-friendly game, as they have sufficient visual stimuli to hold the child’s attention. In this study we investigated the screen time spent by the child, the attention of the child on different categories of images (High Autism Interested or Low Autism Interested images), and the switching patterns of the attention between these images.

The algorithm is widely used to provide superior solutions for optimization and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators including mutation, crossover, and selection. The fittest individuals are chosen for reproduction in this algorithm to generate the next generation’s offspring. Classification is a technique used in data mining to analyze the collected data and to divide them into different classes. The relationship between a known class assignment and the properties of the entity to be classed may serve as the foundation for the classification procedure. Through this research, it has mainly consider classification for documents and images using GA. In order to enhance the accuracy and to reduce the error rate of traditional models, a new approach is proposed which is based on GA. The primary benefit of using GA in conjunction with classification is the efficiency in which it can address optimization issues.

Employees face many difficulties and injustices at their workplaces. People who wish to start a new business, search for legal guidance. When one of these parties needs support, they must seek a lawyer, go to the lawyer, and get legal support. When delivering legal support to clients, lawyers are still going through a manual process. There are very few systems that have been implemented for the law domain so far, and those only search engine types of systems that are unable to support every stakeholder of this domain. There is no common platform for all these stakeholders to find solutions, connect with a good lawyer and get support.

Prop masters and art directors’ assistants are responsible for gathering movie-related props. The selection of props is also essential, because the appeal of a film is dependent on its captivating qualities. It is difficult to select without a solid recommendation and a large gallery. Therefore, the suggested platform is a virtual prop house that works as a prop-specific recommendation system and has additional capabilities such as putting previews and history records. The process necessitates a cross-device platform, as the recommendation system functions as a web page, and when it comes to the improved capabilities of positioning previews, it is transitioning to a mobile application with AR Core support. In this study, the recommendations for the props can be made in one of three efficient ways. They are by reading the script and recommending the props using word recognition, recommending props from the available gallery by scanning an image, which can be a screenshot of a movie, and as associated props which makes the prop master’s job easier by suggesting props by grouping and ranking the most prevalently utilized props in the movies that have been screened so far.","","979-8-3503-9809-0","10.1109/ICAC57685.2022.10025265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10025265","Virtual;Prop House;Suggestion;Recommendation;Script;Props","Image recognition;Films;Web pages;Production;Motion pictures;Solids;Mobile applications","","","","10","IEEE","31 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Containers have become a common choice for microservices architecture instead of VMs (Virtual Machines) due to their portability and optimized resource usage characteristics. Along with the containers, container-orchestration platforms are also becoming an integral part of microservice-based systems, considering the flexibility and scalability offered by the container-orchestration media. With the virtualized implementation and the dynamic attribute of modern microservice architecture, it has been a cumbersome task to implement a proper observability mechanism to detect abnormal behaviour using conventional monitoring tools, which are most suitable for static infrastructures. We present a system that will collect required data with the understanding of the dynamic attribute of the system and identify anomalies with efficient data analysis methods.","","979-8-3503-9809-0","10.1109/ICAC57685.2022.10025259","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10025259","Microservices;Kubernetes;container;eBPF;Autoencoders;LSTM","Scalability;Microservice architectures;Computer architecture;Containers;Media;Virtual machining;Security","","","","20","IEEE","31 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Targeting and experimenting with sustainable ways of Carbon neutrality and management is the pathway toward a greener society. Data show that factories and industries take a high market stake in carbon emission and management. In actions, Governments defined a limit for carbon emissions to each organization which is called carbon credit. Every organization must focus on reducing carbon emissions. This is a critical task for each organization, In some cases, it is still not possible to explore other sustainable options. An innovative solution proposed for the above scenario is to implement a real-time platform that can provide insights into the most up-to-date emission statistics of the organization. This paper provides advanced analytics and precise proactive planning and actions in the simplest form and a discussion on future elaborations and insights about conclusions. By finding the minimum optimal emission values of each emission source, organizations can maintain carbon emissions without exceeding their carbon credit. Also, how industries and factories can create a smart carbon optimization system that can create an even greener society.","","979-8-3503-9809-0","10.1109/ICAC57685.2022.10025276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10025276","carbon emissions;carbon credit;emission constraints;emission sources;optimization","Climate change;Green products;Carbon dioxide;Air pollution;Linear programming;Production facilities;Real-time systems","","","","20","IEEE","31 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result of the social changes it has caused, this crisis will also have an impact on future generations. With the help of this technology, health organizations can quickly locate individuals who are infected with COVID-19 and provide them with medical care. The objective of this work is to develop a COVID-19 Tracer that is capable of COVID-19 detection and mitigation. The goal of this research is to reduce the number of COVID-19-related fatalities in Sri Lanka while also enabling users who are infected with the disease to access appropriate care and hospitalization. This software uses digital technologies to acquire accurate data and provide precise interpretations based on that data. Through the proposed method, patients can be treated using the application to get a precise diagnosis of their disease, maintaining social distance, stabilizing the mental level of the patient through AI, predicting the epidemic, providing COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as ambulance services through this application. Using every preventative measure available, this mobile application has now been developed to safeguard against COVID-19.","","979-8-3503-9809-0","10.1109/ICAC57685.2022.10025082","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10025082","IoT;Augmented Reality;ML;Image Processing;Natural Language Processing;User Assistance Chatbot","COVID-19;Pandemics;Organizations;Human factors;Software;Social factors;Vaccines","","","","10","IEEE","31 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
