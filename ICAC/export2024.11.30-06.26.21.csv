Thus, the prediction of such indexes is always challenging. A comprehensive review carried out by the authors finds that no attempts have yet been carried out to test ARIMA models’ predictive efficacy applied to the New Zealand financial markets. Thus, technical analysis based ARIMA prediction models are developed and empirically tested on the New Zealand stock market (NZX50) index. Daily NZX50 index data are used, and the forecasting precision of the models is assessed based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE]. Our study finds that ARIMA (1, 1, 0) plus intercept is the best order forecasting model out of the models we examined. Once a substantiate algorithm training is implemented, formulated ARIMA models could be successfully employed to forecast the time series of other stock market indexes or the same index for varied periods. Future researchers could compare the forecasting efficiencies of ARIMA with a deep-learning model such as long short-term memory (LSTM). The presence of limited published research of ARIMA applied to the financial markets of New Zealand validates the need and the contribution of this paper.","","978-1-6654-0862-2","10.1109/ICAC54203.2021.9671132","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9671132","Time series prediction;ARIMA models;NZX50 index;New Zealand stock market index;technical analysis","Training;Performance evaluation;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Time series analysis;Memory management;Predictive models","","2","","34","IEEE","11 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Vehicle breakdown is a main issue faced by the vehicle drivers on-road. But depending on the nature of the underlying reason of breakdown, some minor failures can be fixed by the users themselves if they have the basic knowledge, which the majority lacks. If the vehicles undergo a breakdown in a remote location, getting help or finding the required spare parts become a hindrance. In addition to that, vehicle owners need a platform to get a clear idea and comparisons of vehicle insurance companies and insurance packages. As a solution for the above concerns, authors decided to develop a mobile application to assist drivers with vehicle breakdowns and maintenance along with some extra functions. The suggested system’s major functions include providing a personal assistant to aid with vehicle breakdowns, predicting upcoming vehicle maintenance procedures, providing trustworthy spare part pricing, and recommending the best insurance providers to customers. In order to develop the product several technologies and techniques including Natural Language Processing, Neural Networks, and Sentimental Analysis are used.

Additionally, in urban areas, traffic congestion is leading to an increase in air and noise pollution as well. Numerous solutions were tried by authorities, yet no promising results were yielded to address these issues successfully. Contrastingly, increasing road network capacity to solve this problem is very costly and feasible only up to a certain point. Another option is to limit the number of vehicles in the city either by law or by alternative means such as ride-sharing. The best ride-sharing method available is the public transportation, however, due to the limitations of it, upper middle-class opt not to use those hence use their own vehicle to get the expected comfortability. This study is aimed at developing a ride-sharing application by profiling the users based on user reputations, vehicle type, socioeconomic variables such as education, social status, and security concerns of the users, and user ratings.

However, service-to-service communication happens in the present Istio architecture, and there is a probability of exchanging unauthorized and over-provisioned requests due to incorrect implementation. Currently, these requests are verified within the upstream microservice. Obtaining a response to an erroneous request may take considerable time latency. This research thereby aims to address a solution to reduce the latency of a response by implementing an external validation model.

The current systems expected to address the problem of ensuring safety at swimming pools have significant problems due to their technical aspects, such as underwater cameras and methodological aspects such as the need for human intervention in the rescue mission. The use of an automated visual-based monitoring system can help to reduce drownings and assure pool safety effectively. This study introduces a revolutionary technology that identifies drowning victims in a minimum amount of time and dispatches an automated drone to save them. Using convolutional neural network (CNN) models, it can detect a drowning person in three stages. Whenever such a situation like this is detected, the inflatable tube-mounted self-driven drone will go on a rescue mission, sounding an alarm to inform the nearby lifeguards. The system also keeps an eye out for potentially dangerous actions that could result in drowning. This system’s ability to save a drowning victim in under a minute has been demonstrated in prototype experiments' performance evaluations.","","978-1-6654-0862-2","10.1109/ICAC54203.2021.9671126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9671126","Drowning;Lifeguard system;Object detection;Computer vision;Pose estimation;Drone;Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)","Performance evaluation;Computer vision;Neural networks;Prototypes;Cameras;Safety;Convolutional neural networks","","5","","34","IEEE","11 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Other tasks such as reading texts, recognizing people, and describing objects are done in the remote server. We managed to connect the mobile app to the ESP32CAM and the remote server simultaneously. This was possible because the ESP32CAM is connected to the mobile app through Bluetooth. This gave the mobile the ability to connect to the remote server via the internet. To the best of our knowledge, no research has been done using Bluetooth to stream images to do object detection in a mobile app locally. Hence, our solution can detect obstacles locally and do other tasks mentioned previously in the remote server.

In this study, the authors explore the use of Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Internet of Things (IoT), and crowdsourcing to provide insights into the development of the pre and post flood risk management system as a solution to manage and mitigate potential flood risks. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms are used to predict upcoming flooding situations and rainfall occurrences by using predicted weather information and historical data set of flood and rainfall. Crowdsourcing is used as a novel method for identifying flood threatening areas. Weather information is gathered from citizens and it will help to build a procedure to notify the public and authorities of imminent flood risks. The IoT device tracks the real-time meteorological conditions and monitors continuously. The overall outcome showcases that machine learning models, deep learning algorithms, IoT and crowdsourcing information are equally contributing to predict and forecast risky weather conditions. The integration of the above components with machine learning techniques, together with the availability of historical data set, can forecast flood occurrences and disastrous weather conditions with above 0.70 accuracy in specific areas of Sri Lanka.","","978-1-6654-0862-2","10.1109/ICAC54203.2021.9671141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9671141","Crowdsourcing;Deep Learning (DL);Internet of Things (IoT);Machine learning (ML);Rainfall prediction;Flood prediction","Deep learning;Crowdsourcing;Machine learning algorithms;Urban areas;Weather forecasting;Sea measurements;Prediction algorithms","","5","","21","IEEE","11 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When compared to previous methods, the principle underlying Kubernetes, which is containerization, has altered how applications are created and delivered. However, when considering the state, particularly the databases, with Kubernetes, there is a scalability and data synchronization barrier. The most frequently used approach is to host the database outside of Kubernetes and maintain connectivity with the cluster. Kubernetes inherent capabilities are sufficient for hosting databases. But that requires high domain knowledge to do the configurations and maintain the databases on Kubernetes. The purpose of this research is to fulfil that gap by introducing a solution for managing highly available databases on Kubernetes. The solution is limited to managing PostgreSQL databases on Kubernetes using auto-scaling. A novel algorithm is proposed for auto-scaling, as previous algorithms do not take database requests into account when determining the scaling need. The drawbacks of data synchronization and auto-scaling will be solved in this research, and the end user will be able to access the service without interruption for the majority of the time, as the final solution makes the database cluster highly available for the service layer.","","978-1-6654-0862-2","10.1109/ICAC54203.2021.9671185","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9671185","Kubernetes;PostgreSQL;Autoscaling;High Availability;Data Synchronization;Time Series","Databases;Scalability;Synchronization;Distributed computing;Software engineering","","7","","20","IEEE","11 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A trend of recording and publishing videos related to these kinds of violations in various platforms can be observed widely at present. Therefore, the terms and conditions of these platforms are subjected to frequent changes. Difficulty in identifying and controlling of violent events will result in an increase of such cases. Due to these reasons, the demand for violence detection systems will be significantly increased. Efficient violent detection systems are lacking currently.

Town councils have to regularly collect different types of wastes to clean cities/towns. Hence managing the waste of the cities is a challenging task. However, most of the urban councils currently use a manual approach to managing waste. However, it results in many difficulties for the people and cleaning staff who involve in the process by following strict guidelines. Issues due to waste contamination, no proper information management of waste collection, and no punctuality in removing waste from the garbage bins are some of the significant issues arising from the manual process. Due to the drawbacks of the manual approach, social issues, environmental issues, health issues can occur easily. This paper proposes a better solution to replace this manual system with an automated system to overcome these issues. Hence, the main objective of this research is to introduce an ICT-based innovative design that can be used to develop an effective waste management system in town councils. In the proposed model, we will introduce a Computer Vision-based smart waste bin system with real-time monitoring that incorporates various technologies such as computer vision, sensor-based IoT devices, and geographical information system (GIS) related technologies. Our proposed solution consists of a waste bin system, which is capable of automated waste segregation. Our design facilitates the admin users to expand the waste bin kit by adding more waste categories in a user-friendly manner, making our product adaptive in any environment. At the same time, waste bins can notify the real-time waste status. Our system generates the optimum collection routing path and displays it in a mobile app using those real-time status details.

It is also a difficult task to recognize the ripe harvest and experienced labor is required. The efficiency of the harvesting method will be increased by automating the identification process of ripened fruits.

It is exhausting and has a detrimental impact on students' academic life. Therefore, the development of a technique to estimate the probability of depression among undergraduates is a blessed respite. Depression is mostly caused by a failure to check students' psychological well-being on a regular basis. Identifying depression at the college level, leading the students to get proper therapy treatments. If a counselor detects depression in a student early enough, he/she can successfully assist the student in overcoming depression. However, keeping track of the substantial changes that occur in students because of depression becomes challenging for the counselor with a considerable number of undergraduates. The advancement of image processing and machine learning fields has contributed to the creation of effective algorithms capable of identifying depression probability. Depression Possibility Detection Tool (DPDT) is considered an effective automated tool that brings the depression probability of a certain student. In DPDT, the result is generated by concerning four main strategies. They are facial expressions, eye movements, behavior changes (step count and phone usage), and physical conditions (heart rate and sleep rate). Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16) model, Residual Neural Network (ResNet-50), Random Forest (RF) classifier is the main models and techniques used in the system.

It uses a drone equipped with sensors to identify the current composition of the air. After self-identifying the locations with specific distances in a specific area, the drone can go to those locations automatically and obtain sensor readings related to the gas percentages at those locations. After that the data is then transmitted to a computer program which analyzes (cluster analysis methodology), the data and then maps the air pollution in that specific area. Our results provide important informa-tion on how to measure, manage and atmospheric pollution mapping (APM). It also helps to identify air-polluted areas that need to be addressed quickly, and, thereby, it helps to save the atmosphere. We hope to program to get the sensor reading sand analyze the data with a suitable methodology and predict the condition of the atmosphere in the specific area. We hope to use cluster analysis and other analysis methodologies and technologies to this function. We need a dataset to train the model that can do the air quality prediction (AQP) of the relevant area. For that, we surfed the internet and found some datasets regarding the air pollution level of some major countries and their capitals. We think we will be able to make the model by using these datasets and predict the air pollution level of a specific area clearly.

Thus, we desire to emphasize the framework to improve answers for this issue. The research focuses on developing a system that includes early kidney disease prediction models involving machine learning classification algorithms by considering the relevant variables. In predictive analysis, six machine learning methods are used: Support Vector Machine (SVM with kernels), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Multilayer Perceptron. These classification algorithms' performance is evaluated using statistical measures such as sensitivity (recall), precision, accuracy, and F-score. In categorizing, accuracy determines which examples are accurate.

Those logs will be forwarded to our filter, made of a Machine Learning Algorithm (MLA). This will be a custom MLA specially designed for this purpose. MLA will classify and categorize threats according to their severity, filtered log protection system against malware and other threats.","","978-1-6654-0862-2","10.1109/ICAC54203.2021.9671194","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9671194","social networking sites;personality traits;ocean model;log protection;machine learning algorithm","Social networking (online);Oceans;Computational modeling;Organizations;Filtering algorithms;Filtering theory;Malware","","","","26","IEEE","11 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By listening to people's voices, humans can recognize a person's identity, speech fluency, accent, emotions, and stress level. It is difficult to understand what the speaker is saying when Speech fluency is poor. It varies from person to person. With the help of specific information in a person's voice, we can recognize human emotion, stress level, and identity. Every person has a unique vocal feature that facilitates recognizing them from others. This proposed framework is developed to identify a person's identity, emotions, fluency in speaking, and stress level of the speaker using their voice. The proposed framework is developed using machine learning techniques, and deep learning algorithms are highlighted in this study. Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is the used deep learning algorithm, and Fast Fourier transform (FFT), (MFCC), and Random Forest are machine learning techniques. The proposed AI-based framework provides comparatively accurate results in a user-friendly way.","","978-1-6654-0862-2","10.1109/ICAC54203.2021.9671080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9671080","speaker identification;stress analysis;speech emotion analysis;speaker fluency analysis;audio analysis;CNN","Training;Deep learning;Emotion recognition;Machine learning algorithms;Speech analysis;Convolution;Feature extraction","","3","","18","IEEE","11 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent occurrences, both internationally and locally, have shown an influx of these attacks expanding rapidly through the use of malicious URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). Traditional measures, including such blacklisting malicious URLs, make it extremely difficult to respond to such attacks in a timely and efficient manner. Most existing solutions remain restricted in terms of scalability and proactive user safeguarding in situations when freshly formed URLs are correlated with a recent event, such as Covid-19 related frauds. The proposed solution is presented with the primary aim of addressing traditional system limitations and offering an interface for users to protect themselves by detecting phishing/malicious URLs in real time. In this research, we will examine extracting user-input event-related keywords and leveraging NLP (Natural Language Processing) algorithms to match them with the accompanying URL (Uniform Resource Locator) token data to determine whether the URLs are malicious or benign.","","978-1-6654-0862-2","10.1109/ICAC54203.2021.9670883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9670883","Malicious URL Detection;Machine Learning","Uniform resource locators;Computational modeling;Scalability;Feature extraction;Natural language processing;Real-time systems","","1","","19","IEEE","11 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
