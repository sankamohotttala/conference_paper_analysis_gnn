The concept of Value Engineering is applied within the construction industry of many countries to improve the output comparing to conventional practice. Most importantly, adopting conventional practice reasons for less value for the resources use for the construction projects. This is quiet high in public sector projects. Therefore, applying Value Engineering for public sector projects, will give better value for the resources use. Nevertheless, the applications of Value Engineering in public sector construction projects of Sri Lanka are rare. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the challenges that affect the implementation of Value Engineering for the public sector construction projects in Sri Lanka. In order to achieve the above aim, two objectives were implemented as (1) identify the significance of Value Engineering and the challenges affecting to the implementation of Value Engineering for the public sector construction projects in Sri Lanka, and (2) to develop a suitable framework to overcome the challenges affecting the implementation of Value Engineering in public sector construction projects. 23 challenges were identified through a comprehensive literature review and a questionnaire survey was conducted to identify the impact of those challenges and to find out suitable strategies to overcome them. There the data were collected from 71 construction industry professionals with Value Engineering knowledge. Then, the RII technique was adopted to rank the challenges based on the collected data. Eventually, based on the challenges and the proposed strategies a framework was developed for better adaptation of Value Engineering for the public sector construction projects in Sri Lanka.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906210","Value Engineering;Public Sector;Construction Projects;Challenges","Procurement;Knowledge engineering;Costs;Government;Developing countries;Reliability engineering;Teamwork","","","","29","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

People living in low and middle-income countries are ageing much faster than richer countries and over the next three decades, ageing is predominant in Asia. People ageing in low-income communities of the tropics will become more vulnerable to heat with limitations and conditions of the houses they live. Thus, the study appraises the vulnerabilities of elders and the built environment of aging in place in the tropical city of Colombo, Sri Lanka. The selected cohort is permanently residing in a low-income community. Infrared thermal imagery analysis of elders is evident for a mean skin temperature of 34.9° C, which is 1.9° C above a healthy adult. Mean skin temperature further increases in elders living in detached houses. Moreover, the houses demonstrate poor ventilation, and overheated interiors with less usable floor area and windows. Additionally, the elders are suffering from long-term illnesses and their income restricts treatments. Thus, the study portrays an overarching social injustice status of ageing population in cities in Sri Lanka, as elders prefer aging in place. Thus, it highlights the significance of physical attributes of built environment to ensure healthy aging in warming climates.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906212","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906212","ageing in place;built environment;older population;tropics;mean skin temperature","Heating systems;Sociology;Urban areas;Aging;Ventilation;Skin;Thermal analysis","","2","","30","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study presents a methodology to determine the optimum interval for proving inland evacuation routes within a stretch of vulnerable coastal area. It is evident that the developing countries may face financial constraints while providing necessary infrastructure facilities to minimize the fatalities. The establishment of evacuation routes or structures involves expensive capital and maintenance costs. Policymakers need a scientific basis to evaluate the provision of infrastructure facilities as part of planning emergency response strategies. The proposed methodology looks at the trade-off between the cost of providing infrastructure for evacuation and the cost of exposure to the risk. A total cost model is derived as the sum of infrastructure cost and cost of people being exposed to the risk as a function of uniform spacing between inland evacuation routes. The optimum uniform spacing that minimizes the total cost is derived. Thus, the spacing between evacuation routes is obtained as a function of the value of time saved from exposure to the risk, population density in the area, hazard zone depth, walking speed of individuals, and cost of infrastructure. Thus, the derived model is applied to a case study in Thelwaththa Grama Niladhari Division (GND), located in the southern province of Sri Lanka, which was severely affected by the 2004 tsunami event.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906279","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906279","Evacuation;Total cost model;Infrastructures;Value of time","Legged locomotion;Costs;Sociology;Sea measurements;Maintenance engineering;Tsunami;Mathematical models","","","","39","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such a warning mechanism is required to ensure that the public at risk is timely alerted and adequately informed. In proper understanding of this mechanism, the conceptual model development is a significant approach. Here, the activity level sequencing was determined with the analytical illustration of the activity concentration and stakeholder level. Recent studies were considered in conceptual model development. For further verification, the reviews obtained from the pilot expert survey were considered. The developed model was checked for applicability considering disaster situations such as Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004, Cyclone Fani in 2019 and Meethotamulla garbage dump failure in 2017.

Climate change which is accelerated by Green House Gases is a main cause behind the more frequent and intense disasters. Hence, the construction industry is now heading towards Green Buildings as one of the sustainable aspects. Since the involvement in the green building industry in Sri Lanka as well, it has emphasized the importance of incorporating disaster resilience indicators into Green Building Rating Tools (GBRTs) to ensure that green buildings can withstand adverse natural shocks and climatic stresses while maintaining their long-term survivability. There have been various disputes over the concepts “disaster resilience” and “sustainable development,” which have impeded implementation. Therefore, in this research, a multicriteria decision-making tool, the Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) method was used to identify the overall impact of the integration of disaster resilience indicators into a green building framework. It was intended to capture different perspectives of decision makers on each possible disaster resilience aspect that can be integrated into a GBRT related to the Sri Lankan context. The most suitable resilience indicators were selected from the GBRTs and related studies and used in the evaluation. They were assessed for their significance in enhancing disaster resilience as well as the sustainability of green buildings. The results have shown that risk avoidance related indicators can enhance the disaster resilience of the building while increasing the sustainability. Conversely, disaster resilience indicators like improved structural and architectural aspects, and excessive use of hazard-resilient and more robust materials can reduce the overall sustainability of a green building.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906288","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906288","sustainable development;disaster resilience;Sri Lanka;green buildings;Green Building Rating Tools","Green buildings;Electric shock;Buildings;Weather forecasting;Ventilation;Stakeholders;Sustainable development","","1","","36","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Precise 3D full-field measurements are useful in structural optimization, damage detection and retrofitting. Digital Image Correlation is a non-contact optic-based measurement technique that is proven to be an ideal candidate in this regard. It has the potential to become a cheap, simple, and precise solution for deformation measurement. However, the currently available Digital Image Correlation measuring systems require expensive dedicated software packages and physical resources which are difficult to access. Therefore, there is a need to develop a cost-effective measuring technique to effectively use it in the local context. This research focuses on the development and validation of a precise non-contact-based deformation measurement technique. In the proposed method, 3D full-field deformation of the deforming object is measured by processing stereo photographs taken with commonly available digital cameras using the image processing toolbox available in the MATLAB commercial package. Further, the proposed method is enhanced by developing it as a standalone application, which can be installed and conveniently used by any technician. Capability of using the developed application in common civil engineering laboratory experiments has been demonstrated.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906211","University of Moratuwa; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906211","digital image correlation;3D reconstruction;full-field measurements;computer vision","Three-dimensional displays;Correlation;Transducers;Mortar;Digital images;Current measurement;Measurement techniques","","","","26","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An extensive field survey was conducted in connection with the construction sector of Sri Lanka to gather information on the current practices. It was found that the construction industry needs more awareness on correct practices. This study attempts to fill the gap between current field practices and standard practices. Poor workmanship in consolidation of fresh concrete leads to most of the defects, but this study shows how the understanding of technical background of each activity and the proper planning at initial stages contribute to effortless improvements in workmanship. Contradictions between codes of practices for design of reinforced concrete and codes of practices for consolidation of concrete were taken into consideration under this study. In order to identify the locations of hidden honeycombs, a series of UPV tests (conventional approach) were performed, quantitative and qualitative analysis of them has been provided under this study.

The demand for water tanks will continue to increase in the coming years; quick construction methods and economical design approaches will be helpful in the selection of water tanks for relevant applications. Prestressed Concrete (PC) will be a better alternative for Reinforced Concrete (RC) water tanks which are commonly used in Sri Lanka. This paper presents design guidance for PC circular water tanks resting on the ground. The design and construction approaches for PC circular water tanks were identified following EN 1992-1-1:2004 and EN 1992-3:2006 standards. The Midas FEA Finite Element (FE) software was used to analyse the tanks. The economic feasibility of both PC and RC tanks is compared for different tank capacities. The design outputs were converted into structural drawings and bills of quantities. Results of the material take-offs showed that RC is economical only for 4500m3 or less capacity. For higher capacities (above 4500 $\mathrm{m}^{3}$), PC tanks become cheaper by around 12-14%. The information presented in this paper will therefore be helpful to understand the design philosophy for the safe and economical design of water tanks with better crack control.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906267","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906267","Circular water tanks;Prestressed concrete;Reinforced concrete;Design guideline;Economic feasibility","Economics;Philosophical considerations;Design methodology;Concrete;Software;Storage tanks;Finite element analysis","","","","9","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper investigates the damages to the glass façades due to the explosions that occurred inside the five-star hotels, Shangri-La, and Kingsbury in central Colombo. It is evident from previous explosions that the blast-related injuries are mainly caused by the free-flying glass fragments. Laminated Glass (LG) will provide better resistance to explosions that occur outside the building if they are properly designed to be held on the supporting structure. Because, if the blast pressure enters the building, it will cause severe damage to the building elements while creating injuries to the occupants. However, when an explosion occurs inside the building, damage to the building elements and occupants will be severe if the blast pressure cannot escape from the confined building premises easily. Therefore, both of these aspects should be considered when designing glass façades for a credible blast load. LG has better blast resistance than monolithic glass. This paper presents a comprehensive review on the effect of the Easter bombings on glass façades and some design strategies which can be recommended for blast-resistant glazing with the evidence from available literature and design standards.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906182","blast loads;design standards;glass façades;laminated glass;Sri Lanka Easter bombings","Terrorism;Buildings;Vents;Design standards;Glass;Explosions;Explosives","","1","","15","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the excessive material usage in bracket manufacturing will lead to expensive constructions, increased energy consumption and a rise in carbon footprint. To circumvent these challenges, this paper demonstrates a novel approach for producing an optimum and sustainable steel bracket for pedestrian bridge construction. Topology optimization is used as the tool of choice in this work, which has a proven record of arriving at the highest stiffness to weight ratio. This study uses an existing steel bridge bracket in Castleford Foot Bridge, England as a study case. The bracket is optimized under several volume fractions and ultimately, the optimum design is selected based on both simulation results and practical considerations. It is shown that a considerable amount of material could be saved without sacrificing the strength and stiffness requirement of the bridge bracket. Without a loss of generality, the selected optimal design is manually extracted to a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software for further post-processing and analysis.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906146","topology optimization;steel brackets;structural optimization;bridge construction;additive manufacturing;sustainable designs;computer-aided design","Bridges;Geometry;Solid modeling;Design automation;Three-dimensional printing;Manufacturing;Topology","","","","20","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Literature on experimental studies unfolds that there is a considerable reduction in bending stiffness of these ultra-thin woven composites when subjected to curvatures. This paper presents a numerical investigation that incorporates inter-tow and inter-lamina interaction behaviour on the homogenized response of a two-ply plain woven carbon fibre composite. Two distinct models were used in the analysis with dry fibre approach and resin embedded geometry. The analysis is advanced further towards the non-linear regime to predict the response under higher curvatures.

A tsunami relative risk index (TRRI) has recently been proposed for hospital buildings based on such an approach. This study extends the concept to reinforced concrete school buildings. Two typical plan forms of school buildings were explored, each of two and three storey height. The criterion for overall structural failure was the shear capacity of columns; for scour, the number of footings undermined; and for debris impact, the shear capacity of corner columns. Of the parameters explored, the inundation depth and flow velocity were found to have the greatest influence on TRRI, while building type, building height and flow direction had much smaller influence. Debris impact was the governing risk at low inundation depths (around 1m), with scour at medium depths (around 3m) and overall structural shear failure at higher depths (around 5m).","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906157","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906157","Tsunami;Relative Risk Index;School buildings;Structure;Scour;Debris","Numerical analysis;Hospitals;Oceans;Buildings;Production;Tsunami;Floods","","","","13","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study explores storing plastic waste in concrete as a partial replacement of the fine aggregate to produce a useful building material. To resolve the material's lack of compressive strength, this study used HDPE chemically treated with Sodium Hypochlorite (NaOCl) and partially replaced the cement with silica fume at 7.5%, and 10% to improve the concretes Interfacial Transition Zones (ITZ). This research tests the workability, density, and compressive strength, and completes a microstructure analysis of this material to determine if structural lightweight concrete (SLWC) can be produced. The results obtained indicate that adding silica fume with chemically treated aggregate increased the compressive strength by 1.9% and 7.4% respectively in comparison to the control. Through the statistical analysis, these additions were then shown to make a significant difference in the concrete's strength. The microstructure analysis too confirmed that the quality of the ITZs had improved in these mixtures. However, the workability of these 2 mixtures was reduced by 77.4%. The study concludes that although the concrete isn't lightweight, its compressive strength can be improved to match that of conventional structural concrete.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906143","HDPE;Interfacial transition zone;Lightweight structural concrete;Compressive strength;Plastic Fine aggregates","Silicon compounds;Workability;Waste management;Industries;Statistical analysis;Aggregates;Sodium","","1","","21","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To fulfill the housing requirements of the ever-growing population with the scarcity of valuable lands, the best solution is to come up with high-rise or medium-rise apartment buildings. Even though there are different structural forms that can be incorporated into high-rise apartment structures, most of the time structural designers select based on their experience and approach which are not effective all the time. The structural design for a given structure should be optimum in terms of structural performance and associated costs. Since wind and seismic forces govern the design of high-rise structures, those lateral forces are significant to be studied. So, this analytical study was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of six different structural systems of 20-story RC (Reinforced Concrete) structures under the effect of wind and seismic loadings including a moment-resisting frame as the base model, four wall frame structures and a frame-tube structure. Models are compared based on the parameters such as maximum top storey displacement, inter-storey drift ratios, member forces and moments utilization, seismic induced base shear and human perception levels of lateral acceleration.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906243","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906243","Structural forms;Medium-rise buildings;Shear walls;Rigid frames;Frame-tube","Buildings;Sociology;Loading;Earthquakes;Bending;Insulators;Statistics","","","","9","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Concrete-filled double-skin steel tube (CFDST) is a composite construction component. It consists of two steel layers with concrete sandwiched in between the tubes. The inner hollow steel section acts as formwork and reinforcement for the concrete. CFDST has numerous advantages, which include high strength, high bending stiffness, and good seismic and fire performance. Moreover, this type of structural member is not being used largely in construction, hence it’s vital to investigate and obtain a clear analysis of the implementations. This study presents a detailed investigation of how CFDSCT columns behave under axial compression, by experimenting and further verifying it through analysis of the structural component by developing a numerical model using “ABAQUS” finite element software. The experimental results were further compared to theoretical calculations performed using the “Eurocode 4” design standard. The simulation and the theoretical data are in good compliance with the test results. Ultimately, using a numerical model developed with SAP2000 software, this study discusses the feasibility of using CFDST columns in buildings in seismic performance.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906162","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906162","concrete-filled double-skin circular steel tubes;Axial compression;Finite element analysis;Seismic performance","Wiring;Buildings;Bending;Software;Concrete;Electron tubes;Numerical models","","","","13","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, this study was carried out to develop a framework focusing on the sustainable management and utilisation of wetland resources at Madinnagoda marsh. The DPSIR (Drivers–Pressures–State changes–Impacts-Responses) framework was used for the study, an excellent tool for analysing environmental issues and devising sustainable solutions.

To fulfil this gap and for reliable yield estimation, a proper comparison should be undertaken incorporating the available water yield models. The IGM and HEC-HMS models were selected and compared by using the observed streamflow data of Kirindi Oya and Maduru Oya in the present study. Model parameters were identified by an extensive literature survey. Daily and 75% probable rainfall data were considered as the input data for the models and the model results were compared with the observed streamflow data. The evaluation has been carried out by using the flow hydrograph, annual water balance, flow duration curves, runoff coefficients and the MRAE value as an indicator.

Four Junctions which are controlled manually during the peak hours were selected and modelled for three cases, existing posted signal time, updated traffic signal time, and traffic police phase arrangement and cycle time in VISSIM. Webster & Cobbe (1966) model used to design signals and modified to achieve optimum delay. Manual control results lesser delays than the existing signal time case. But updated signal times result even lesser delay than the manual control. When the junction is over-saturated, delays for manual control by traffic police result lesser delay than the existing signal times. Delays for minor road movement delays for signal control have significant reduction of delay than manual control. Daily variation of traffic also affects the junction delays significantly as the fixed cycle time signals are used. Introducing vehicle actuated signals will be an effective solution.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906147","Cycle time;Phase;Delay;Queue Length","Law enforcement;Roads;Urban areas;Human factors;Switches;Control systems;Software","","","","30","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many studies on the time headway distribution on highways and urban roads serve two primary purposes. The studies that serve the latter purpose, service level, have not been given adequate attention. In fact, at manual toll stations, traffic congestion is still a severe problem. Predicting the time headway at toll stations becomes extremely meaningful when the service providers can allocate resources reasonably, minimizing waiting time in off-peak periods and utilizing resources during high-demand periods. This study applies two modern machine learning methods to predict the time headway at Niigata toll stations, Japan, namely Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), which only requires simple input of time series, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which requires some additional external features.

This paper is proposed a novel method of image segmentation of cyclists and motor cyclists and subsequent detection with image moments in traffic video footage. However, isolation of pedal cycles and motorcycles with perfect object boundaries has been a challenging problem with respect to other vehicle categories in the context of image segmentation. Irregular shape image segmentation for pedal cyclists and motor cyclists using a novel recursive image segmentation algorithm is proposed in this work The recursive image segmentation algorithm is applied to extract image pixels of a moving object in the binary image. The extraction of all the pixels of a bicycle could be accomplished successfully using the proposed algorithm. Subsequently, pixel count, height, width and the image Hu moments are recorded and used to identify the motorcycle category. An accuracy of 91.2% was obtained for video footage duration of 6 minutes video sequence for the detection of cyclists and motor cyclists.

The values of Factor of Safety against sliding and overturning, varying with the shear key’s depth and location, are presented as graphical representations. Finite Element Analysis was carried out using PLAXIS 2D software to analyze the variation of the overall stability with the increasing depth of the shear key. The limit equilibrium analysis observed that utilizing a shear key enhances the stability of the retaining wall against sliding. It was also found that the increase in the depth of the shear key reduces the stability of the retaining wall against overturning, and the optimum location of the shear key is at the heel of the wall base.

In this study, MSW samples obtained from the Meethotamulla landfill site, Sri Lanka, subjected to DC under both saturated and unsaturated conditions, were tested using the Rowe cell apparatus. Their compressibility characteristics were established under four conditions: saturated-compacted, saturated-noncompacted, unsaturated-compacted, and unsaturated-noncompacted. The results of the analysis indicated that the improvement of density and compressibility characteristics of MSW due to DC is greater under the unsaturated condition.

If the infiltration of rainwater can be reduced the construction of a deep vertical excavation support system can be optimized. A Capillary Barrier (CB) which consists of a fine layer lying on top of a coarse layer at the ground level can cut off the infiltration into the lower layers. In this research study, initially, attempts were made to establish the critical parameters through parametric studies. A laboratory model of a Capillary Barrier was constructed with instrumentation and a rainfall pattern was applied. Experimental results were verified with GeoStudio, 2012 SEEP/W software and there was a very good agreement.

As a result, the pavement deteriorates at a higher rate compared to normal bituminous pavement. Hence, toll lanes near toll plazas are constructed as heavy reinforced concrete rigid pavements. In Sri Lanka, the same technique is used for rigid pavements near expressway toll plaza structures. Due to the high cost of this method, the objective of this research is to present a cost-effective way with acceptable efficiency by comparing methods and technologies that other countries use to construct rigid pavement in toll lanes. To achieve this objective, the used design methods and the material cost of the ColomboKatunayake expressway at Peliyagoda and Seeduwa toll entrances, Dambokka and Kurunegala toll entrances in the Northern expressway are discussed in this study. The study revealed that the replacement of reinforced concrete pavements in the above toll gates with Ultra-thin continuously reinforced concrete pavement can decrease the material cost by 7.97% at Peliyagoda, 36.08% at Seeduwa, 5.66% at Dambokka, and 5.48% at Kurunegala.

The volume fraction of each phase will decide the material’s insulation properties and can be analyzed using experimental, analytical, and numerical methods.

However, the presence of toxic lead in these materials is a significant concern for human health. Therefore, it is essential to select the elements for solar cell design that are environmentally friendly and conducive to human health. Many non-toxic alternatives can be used to solve this problem. Among those alternatives, Bismuth-based perovskite has become a promising alternative due to similar photovoltaic properties and enhanced environmental stability. Bismuth ternary based halide has interected due to their superior stability, but the main disadvantage is their wide band gap for single junction solar cells. The incorporation of the chalcogenide anions into bismuth chalcogenides was reported to have smaller bandgaps than that of the halide bismuth perovskites, which could reduce their bandgaps without affecting their photovoltaic properties. Band gap and dominant band to band absorption could be predictable from electronic property calculations using ground state density functional theory (DFT) as the lowest energy difference between the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM). As a result, for photovoltaic applications, the structural and band gap properties of mixed chalcogen and halogen anions, CH3NH3Bi (Ch, X)3 (Ch = chalcogen; X = halogen), were calculated using a combination of density- functional theory calculations. Results reveal that the band gaps of CH3NH3BiChI2S and CH3NH3BiChI2Se are 1.39 eV and 1.34 eV, which are in the range of band gaps required for photovoltaics.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906215","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906215","Chalcogenide;Band gap;Density of state;Perovskite.Solar absorber","Photovoltaic systems;Chalcogenides;Photonic band gap;Absorption;Photovoltaic cells;Discrete Fourier transforms;Bismuth","","","","21","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is an increasing demand for environment-friendly reinforcing materials in the industry. Previous studies done in this laboratory suggested that microcrystalline cellulose-based composite has better properties such as tensile strength, elastic modulus, stiffness, water absorption, and thermal stability. The property optimization solely through an experimental approach costs a lot of time and resources. However, if a reliable model can be developed to explain the composition property relationship, the cost can be significantly reduced. A simple rule of mixture-based models does not adequately explain the variation of mechanical properties with the composition. This paper discusses a modified form of a mathematical model based on a rule of mixture principles to predict the mechanical behavior of microcrystalline cellulose-based polymer composites. The model aims to predict the mechanical property variation of Microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) reinforced composites.

This paper analyzes the kinetics of the thermal endurance of plasticizers present in locally available electrical cable insulations. For this purpose, a model was developed to map higher temperature accelerated plasticizer evaporation kinetics to lower temperature practically experiencing values. Plasticizer evaporation data were collected in the range of 80-160 °C. Since the plasticizer evaporation reaction occurs over the considered temperature range, notable physical transitions (e.g., crystallization or glass transition) were not observed within the mentioned temperature range. Therefore, The Arrhenius-principle-based approach was employed to map accelerated condition measurements to ambient condition evaporation. An Experimentally determined evaporation behavior was used to define the evaporation kinetics of plasticizers.

To obtain information from the satellite data, the Maximum likelihood supervised classification technique and post-classification change detection strategy were applied. Besides, Spectral indices were utilized to define the ground truth. Thus, the study area was divided into four main land use/cover classes, and hence five satellite images for the years; 1997, 2007, 2014, 2017, and 2019 with low cloud cover were identified. According to the study, urban development resulted in a significant conversion of vegetation cover to the urban development of around 36 km2 during the past 22 years. The generated map showed that between 1997 and 2019, the built-up area increased by 43.62 percent whereas vegetation cover decreased by 41.72 percent. The overall precision of the data produced ranged from 72 to 81 percent. The dramatic growth of the urban population will boost the risk of natural environmental diminishing. This study assesses the change in the LULC pattern for the previous 22 years, providing useful information for the urban planners to make sustainable environmental decisions.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906148","Change detection;LULC;Maximum likelihood supervised classification;Spectral indices","Maximum likelihood detection;Satellites;Urban areas;Sociology;Vegetation mapping;Statistics;Remote sensing","","1","","14","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This lack of secure supply coupled with high-grade resource depletion has led to increased explorations on potential low-grade resources of REEs. Thus, the present study focuses on the enrichment of REEs in intrusive rocks in Sri Lanka – a prospective low-grade REE resource. We analyzed fifty-five rock samples from a few granitic bodies (Massenna, Thonigala, Arangala), Eppawala Phosphate Deposit (EPD), and Ratthota pegmatite for their REE concentrations. Amongst the studied prospects, EPD (4185 mg/kg), Arangala granite (2183 mg/kg), and Massenna granite (937 mg/kg) had high REE concentrations with increased LREE enrichments over HREEs. However, EPD contains processable REE minerals (apatite and monazite), and REEs can be extracted as a by-product after developing the phosphate fertilizer production flow. Thus, EPD is the highest prospective of all the studied intrusive rocks of Sri Lanka. Compared to global occurrences, although it is low-grade (0. 48 wt% REO, 0.29 million tons REE reserve), such low-grade REE resources could become viable in the future due to the ever-increasing demand and the expected resource depletion of REEs.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906196","Ministry of Higher Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906196","Rare earth metal exploration;Granites;Carbonatites;Eppawala phosphate deposit","Rare earth metals;Production;Low-carbon economy;Rocks;Minerals;Fertilizers","","1","","23","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Seasonal weather patterns, anthropogenic activities, such as surface mining, wastewater discharge and invasive plant growth typically govern these dynamics. Measuring, and monitoring, these factors over the spatial extent of these waterbodies require significant efforts. Yet, remote sensing and earth observation data can effectively minimize these efforts. This study employs both Landsat and Sentinel satellite data to estimate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference water index (NDWI) to develop a relatively accurate classification of the water-vegetation dynamics over the time of interest. The Google Earth Engine and ArcGIS software were used to download and generate the classifications over six years (2016-2021) for four different seasons (i.e., 24 processed images). The classified time series data show that the vegetation cover varies at two temporal frequencies. The annual variation of the water, vegetation, and non-vegetation (other) classes is consistent and cyclic. However, at a finer temporal resolution (i.e., on seasonal cycles), vegetation dynamics fluctuate rapidly.

However, supplying outdoor air with increased levels of CO2 will adversely affect for the health and the productivity of the occupants. In this study, it was found that the CO2 levels in the indoor environments increase with the increased atmospheric CO2 levels and the recirculation air percentage. When the CO2 level of the outdoor air is higher, IAQ can only be controlled by supplying more fresh air to the indoor environment. However, it increases the load on the Cooling Coil and eventually, electricity consumption of the chiller increases.

Slugflow is one of the regimes in two-phase flow that has higher rates of heat and mass transfer in microchannels compared to other types because of the internal fluid recirculation within the slugs. The addition of nanoparticles to one of the phases in slug-flow could further increase the heat transfer rates. Therefore, in this research, nanofluid-based liquid-liquid slug-flow was studied. Studies were carried out numerically using ANSYS Fluent®. A series of studies were carried out to investigate the effect of nanoparticles on heat transfer. Aluminium oxide (Al2O3) was selected as nanoparticles due to its physical and chemical stability along with its high thermal conductivity. Numerical results were validated with the experimental data available in the literature. Interface capturing of two-phase flow was done using VOF (Volume-of-Fluid) and Eulerian–Eulerian mixture models. The results showed a significant heat transfer enhancement when using nanoparticles in either phase. Two-phase slug-flow itself has shown up to four-times the increase in heat transfer in terms of Nusselt Number in the literature.

The induced hot-air plume creates elevated temperatures in higher floors adversely impacting the energy efficiency of condensing units. The strength of the heat plume and the temperature rise depend on several factors including condenser arrangement, shape and size of the re-entrants, and air-conditioner loading conditions. Hence, the present study focused on analyzing the heat column generation using CFD and evaluating the group performance of the condensers with the different condenser arrangements using the performance indices such as GCPR, GCCR, and GCER.

Using the proposed framework, several case studies are conducted on the IEEE Reliability Test System to analyze the impact of integrating renewables on the adequacy of composite systems. The results show that wind generation tends to improve system reliability than solar due to its higher availability. In addition, the equivalent capacities of wind and solar generators are found to be 125MW and 215MW against a 50MW hydro generator.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906208","National Research Council; University of Moratuwa; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906208","composite system adequacy;evolutionary swarm algorithm;power system reliability;renewables;wind and solar integration","Renewable energy sources;Interconnected systems;Evolutionary computation;Wind power generation;Reliability engineering;Generators;Power system reliability","","","","17","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Diesel generators are connected to the network to maintain system reliability under emergency states. With increasing penetration of non-dispatchable, rooftop solar-PV, proper planning is required to maintain system stability and reliability. Commercial and industrial cities do not follow the conventional diurnal load patterns, but presents load patterns similar to the diurnal generation curve of solar-PV. Thus, by introducing solar-PV, required diesel generation capacity can be reduced. Also, the system reliability and stability can be improved if the system is operated as a microgrid. The ability of forming ring-radial connected hybrid-microgrid based on an existing network for a commercial city with peak day-time loading is evaluated. Small-signal stability analysis reveals that, even with 100% solar-PV, the islanded microgrid in normal state is stable under different diesel generation integration topologies tested. The system becomes unstable due to small perturbations under the N-l emergency operation in some topologies. This study allowed identification of the proper diesel generation integration topology for the proposed microgrid.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906252","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906252","diesel-solar hybrid microgrids;microgrid stability;ring-radial microgrids;small-signal stability analysis","Substations;Network topology;Urban areas;Loading;Microgrids;Voltage;Generators","","","","6","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Energy consumption benchmarks for commercial sector, hospitality industry, apparel industry and tea processing industry have been already developed and are available for Sri Lanka. However, electricity and water consumption benchmarking for retail supermarkets have not been established yet. Therefore, during this study, electricity and water consumption benchmarking for Sri Lankan retail supermarkets were estimated and proposed. According to the analysis, electricity consumption benchmarks were obtained as 780.0 kwh/year/m2 per sales floor area and 465.4 kwh/year/m2 per total floor area. Moreover, mean specific electricity costs were obtained as 19,465.90 Rs/year/m2 per sales floor area and 11,621.20 Rs/year/m2 per total floor area, provided that electricity cost is calculated per GP 2 tariff structure of Ceylon electricity board. In addition, water consumption benchmarks were obtained as 246.5 L/year/m2 per sales floor area and 137.2 L/year/m2 per total floor area. Moreover, a building energy simulation model was developed using eQUEST simulation software, to obtain the specific electricity consumption and average annual electricity consumption breakdown of the retail supermarkets.

In this background, this research focused on DualSPHysics-based numerical prediction of the energy conversion efficiency (ECE) and survivability of an OWSC in irregular waves observed in a selected coastal location of Sri Lanka. It was found that the Power take-off (PTO) damping coefficient, the density of the oscillating flap and the shape of the flap highly influence the ECE and the hydrodynamic forces on the WEC deciding its survivability. If the density of the flap is in the range of 400 - 600 kg/m3 and its shape is more concave, the ECE increases significantly (about 25%) while improving its survivability. On the other hand, a significant reduction (25 to 47 %) in hydrodynamic forces could be achieved using cone or semicone-shaped flaps at the expense of ECE which would be a good alternative for high energetic seas.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906284","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906284","DualSPHysics;Energy Conversion Efficiency;Flap Geometry;Hydrodynamic Forces;OWSC;Wave Energy","Damping;Geometry;Renewable energy sources;Shape;Wave power;Force;Sea measurements","","1","","24","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even though passive cooling options are available to mitigate this issue, they have been shown to be insufficient to meet the anticipated need. To achieve the desired level of comfort, residents of the building must use active cooling systems. The widely available active cooling systems are vividly demonstrated to be unsustainable and energy-intensive.

Although this risk has been identified, limited research has been conducted in energy demand predictions in these climatic zones. Nevertheless, the use of data driven modelling for demand predictions of buildings is becoming popular around the world. Hence, this paper focuses on developing a model to predict indoor temperature from outdoor conditions to estimate the cooling energy demand. The model presented is a hybrid model which is a combination of physics based and data driven models. The model was trained and validated for an existing office building in a tropical climate zone. Model parameters were calculated using different surveys. The developed model has been used to calculate the cooling energy demand of the selected zones.

The success of these companies’ efforts is mainly determined by how employees participate in the implementation process. Moreover, manufacturers worldwide are being pushed to embrace green manufacturing practices by raising the environmental knowledge of employees. Thus, this study investigated the direct and indirect impact of green manufacturing practices (GMP) on employee green behaviour (EGB) along with employee green knowledge (EGK) as the mediator of this study.

Thermal energy storage can be incorporated into CSP plants to improve dispatchability. Thus, the development of high-temperature Thermal Energy Storage (TES) materials is essential to enhance the performance of CSP plants. Phase Change Materials (PCM) show favourable characteristics to be used as the working material in this application. This paper addresses the selection of appropriate storage materials that have desirable properties for thermal energy storage in CSP applications, considering the cost and volume per unit of thermal energy storage. A three-stage screening process based on melting temperature, latent heat of fusion, cost, thermal conductivity and storage volume criteria was used to select the most economical and thermo-physically feasible materials from a list of 25 materials. Accordingly, Na2CO3+Li2 CO3 (56:44), Li2 C$\mathrm{O}_{3}+\mathrm{K}_{2}$CO3(2S:72), Li2 C$\mathrm{O}_{3}+\mathrm{K}_{2}$CO3 (35:65), NaF+K$\mathrm{F}+\mathrm{K}_{2}$CO3 (17:21:62), LiCO3+Na2C$\mathrm{O}_{3}+\mathrm{K}_{2}$CO3 (20:60:20), Li2 CO3+Na2C$\mathrm{O}_{3}+\mathrm{K}_{2}$CO3 (22:16:62), K2 CO3+Na2CO3 (51:49) S PCMs were selected as the best materials to develop high temperature TES for CSP plants.

The presence of improved consumer products according to consumer’s preference for cooking fuels in these regions acts as a major motivator for cookstove adoption. Hence, understanding household preference for clean cooking solutions is useful for policy makers and organisations involved with the cooking fuel supply chain and product development. In order to better understand household decision-making in Sri Lanka, a stated preference survey and discrete choice model were constructed.

The VQA model’s most crucial task is to learn the question-image joint representation to reflect the information related to the correct answer. Medical VQA remains a difficult task due to the ineffectiveness of question-image embeddings, despite recent research on general VQA models finding significant progress. To address this problem, we propose a new method for training VQA models that utilizes adversarial learning to improve the question-image embedding and illustrate how this embedding can be used as the ideal embedding for answer inference. For adversarial learning, we use two embedding generators (question–image embedding and a question-answer embedding generator) and a discriminator to differentiate the two embeddings. The questionanswer embedding is used as the ideal embedding and the question-image embedding is improved in reference to that. The experiment results indicate that pre-training the question-image embedding generation module using adversarial learning improves overall performance, implying the effectiveness of the proposed method.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906168","medical visual question answering;adversarial learning.","Training;Visualization;Computer vision;Limiting;Computational modeling;Adversarial machine learning;Generators","","","","21","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although chest X-Ray image captioning is currently done manually by radiologists, automating it has received growing research interest in the medical domain because it is a tedious task and the high number of medical reports that are to be generated daily. In this paper, we propose an automatic chest X-ray captioning system consisting of two main components: an image feature extractor and a sentence generator. We did our experiment in two approaches. First, we tried using LXMERT, which is originally designed for question answering, as the sentence generator in our model combined with the Faster RCNN model. Second, we used CheXNet and a memory-driven transformer as the feature extractor and the sentence generator respectively. We trained and tested our model using the IU chest X-ray dataset. We evaluated the model using the BLUE, ROUGE-L and METEOR metrics which shows the CheXNet based approach outperforms the latter models.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906263","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906263","Chest x-ray Captioning;Transformers;CheXNet","Measurement;Natural languages;Radiology;Feature extraction;Transformers;Generators;Question answering (information retrieval)","","4","","23","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These platforms support most of the native languages and this has enabled people to express their opinions conveniently. Also, it is very common to observe that people express very hateful opinions on social media platforms as well. Several studies have been carried out in this area for the Sinhala language with traditional machine learning models and none of them have shown promising results. Further, current approaches are far behind the latest techniques carried out in high-resource languages. Hence this study presents a deep learning-based approach for hate speech detection which has shown outstanding results for other languages. Moreover, a deep learning ensemble was constructed from these models to evaluate performance improvements. These models were trained and tested on a newly created dataset using the Twitter API. Moreover, the model generalizability was further tested by applying it to a completely new dataset. As per the results, it can be observed that the proposing approach has outperformed the traditional machine learning models and is well generalized. Finally, the experimentation with extra features also reveals that there is a positive impact on the performance using extra features.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906232","Hate speech;Sinhala;Deep learning;Ensemble;NLP","Deep learning;Social networking (online);Hate speech;Blogs;Focusing;Performance gain","","3","","12","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is despite several constraints in the process of producing organic foods. Producers should aim to maximize their profit by catering to the rising demand of this niche market. Manufacturing cost per unit is comparatively higher in the organic chain compared to the conventional chain. Hence, producers must make critical decisions when supplying their products to different markets. A Python-based Linear Programming optimization model tested using Google optimization Tools has been developed to identify the optimum delivery volume that should be supplied to each market which has been identified in this empirical study. The designed model aims to maximize profits by minimizing unsold products and postharvest waste. The developed model can guide producers who operate in the organic perishable supply chain to gain market benefits in short food supply chains. There is a lack of research on sustainability aspects in agricultural coordination and applications in supply network performance. Therefore, this study fills this gap by addressing the issue of postharvest waste in the distribution process of organic vegetables and fruits.

Most economic sectors are laid upon detrimental results due to an unorganized transportation network. This is a crucial issue faced by developing countries. There is no doubt that highways should be built in order to maximize the throughput of the transportation network; nevertheless, expansion of existing roads is also not applicable in countries like Sri Lanka due to its ceasing land area with increasing population. Thus it is essential to switch to a more efficient, technologically advanced approach to solve this issue. In addition to the typical congestion scenarios, the prevailing pandemic situation has realized the importance of prioritizing ambulances when it is caught amidst a traffic jam. Pedestrians are another vital part of the road network. Effective and safe pedestrian crossing will ensure the reduction of road accidents while improving the existing heavy traffic. A smart traffic monitoring system integrated to control the traffic signals is the ideal solution in this context.

Using effective steering mechanisms, soft-growing robots can grow along the desired path. Series pneumatic artificial muscles (sPAMs) are used as steering actuators in contemporary soft-growing robots. This paper presents the experimental evaluation of the effect of the sPAM configuration on the bending of a soft-growing robot. The paper also includes the design and fabrication of the robot body and the sPAMs, the experimental setup, and the analysis of the observed results. The soft-growing robot body and sPAMs are made of low-density polyethylene (LDPE). The effect of four sPAM configurations (n sPAMs in m groups) on the bending angle and the blocked force is experimentally evaluated. Experimental results show that the bending angle is proportional to the number of sPAMs in a group (Bending angle reduces from 33° to 12° as the number of sPAMs in the group is reduced from 6 to 2). The blocked force applied by the robot tip remains constant over all the tested sPAM configurations. Hence, by varying sPAM configurations, a designer will be able to change the bending angle of a soft-growing robot without affecting tip forces.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906266","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906266","Artificial muscles;Bio-inspired design;Soft Robot Materials and Design;Vine robot","Robot motion;Actuators;Polyethylene;Force;Bending;Pneumatic systems;Soft robotics","","1","","19","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In Sri Lanka, this requires clean digital images of documents such as the National Identity Card (NIC), driver’s license etc. which often have background textures and reflective surfaces. Due to human error, uneven natural light and reflectance properties, such document images contain cast shadows which pose a difficulty to further processing. The NIC dataset itself is unique in nature. It has some properties unique to a document image, i.e., dark letters on a light background, and some properties unique to a natural image, i.e., background object textures. Therefore, the target domain or nature of dataset itself is a novelty. For such domain, we propose a shadow removal mechanism based on Dual Hierarchical Aggregation Network (DHAN) and VGG-19 (Convolutional network by Visual Geometry Group) object detection deep learning model. Since previous research is not already done on this specific target area, we do not have a direct benchmark to compare our proposed methodology. Hence, we have experimented our dataset with already existing state of the art models in both shadow removal for document images and shadow removal for natural images. Our proposed model reflects the typical backbone architecture for shadow removal models for natural images when removing shadows while preserving background textures. Our architecture can be directly utilised or added to an already-existing image processing pipeline. Although our target domain is relatively new, for comparison purpose we went comparing our model with a close relative which is shadow removal on natural images. Our architecture results in an overall quality improvement of 12% and 63% improvement in output resolution when compared with the state-of-the-art architecture in shadow removal for natural images.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906227","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906227","shadow removal;textured surface;reflective surface;document images","Surface cleaning;Visualization;Image resolution;Runtime;Computer architecture;Object detection;Surface texture","","1","","30","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We compare the results of 6 commonly used machine learning models to find the best performing classifier for recognizing individual characters of words.

A robust yet accurate force controller can be developed by implementing both RTOB and DOB. This study examines the potential instability of force controllers based on RTOB. Traditionally, a RTOB-based force controller is examined under the presumption that the two cut-off frequencies for DOB and RTOB should always be equal to one another. But in some circumstances, it fails to maintain stability. The stability of the system is determined by the interactions between the mechanical, environmental, and controller dynamics, which also add to design constraints. There has not been any analysis of unstable scenarios in terms of system dynamics. In this paper, a novel stability constraint is derived as a result of the new stability assessment approach that is proposed. A new stability guideline is also suggested. The simulation results are used to confirm the validity of the proposals.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906228","disturbance observer (DOB);reaction torque observer (RTOB);force controller;motion control systems and stability","Viscosity;Torque;System dynamics;Stability criteria;Force;Dynamics;Cutoff frequency","","","","14","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose and compare two different deep learning and convolutional neural network methods to detect and extract the region of water pooling areas, such as gutters, abandoned ponds, tires, and other water retaining areas on rooftops, using UAVs based aerial images. The performance comparison between the YOLOv4 algorithm and the Mask-RCNN algorithm was explored in the case study to identify the best deep learning method for detecting these uneven regions of water pooling. Experimental results show that the Mask-RCNN approach efficiently detects these uneven areas in an aerial image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance. On the other hand, YOLOv4 detects the best bounding box for the area of interest. The mean average precision (mAP) scores for Mask-RCNN and YOLOv4 are 71.67% and 57.9% respectively. The Mask-RCNN system has shown promising results on test images and video clips. Such real-time detection systems would eventually help to identify mosquito breeding sites to assist the dengue eradication as well as to identify suitable water resources for daily uses, thereby facilitating a better community health system.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906204","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906204","water pooling regions;Mask-RCNN;Yolov4;aerial images;region detection;UAV","Deep learning;Image segmentation;Biological system modeling;Predictive models;Streaming media;Prediction algorithms;Tires","","2","","24","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our approach for recognizing fingerspelling signs involve decoupling pose classification from pose estimation and using postural synergies to reduce the dimensionality of features.

Therefore, a cost effective and flexible solution is introduced in this paper with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and terrestrial base stations (TBSs), coexisting under a stochastic network with the combination of millimeter waves and non-orthogonal access (NOMA) techniques. This is achieved by deploying both the UAVs (millimeter wave frequencies) and TBSs (sub-6 GHz frequencies) in the same system, and selecting the transmitter based on a user association scheme. The maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and the closest transmitter user association schemes are compared using extensive simulations to identify the most suitable scheme in terms of the outage probability and the achievable downlink rate. The results show that the closest transmitter user association policy results in lower outage probability and higher downlink rates for UAV-assisted millimeter wave NOMA Networks.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906161","Millimeter Waves;non-orthogonal multiple access;user association schemes;unmanned aerial vehicles.","NOMA;Costs;Transmitters;Millimeter wave technology;Interference;Probability;Downlink","","","","16","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a biomimetic design of a bicondylar knee joint capable of 3D motion. The development of bicondylar surfaces is limited by the absence of accurate condylar surface development methodologies. Hence, this paper proposes a novel methodology, to obtain accurate bicondylar surfaces. The proposed method is used to develop a physical knee joint model. This knee joint model is experimentally evaluated using a model lower limb test setup (replicating the ankle, knee, and hip). The squatting motion of a human is replicated using this test setup. The hip motion of a healthy male test subject is recorded via image capture, and the hip joint of the test setup is actuated to follow this path. The computational model of the knee joint is used to predict the expected motion path during squatting, and the experimental result is compared against it. The results show RMSEs of less than 2.4 mm and 5.78 mm for anterior-posterior and inferior-superior displacements, respectively. Hence, it shows that the proposed bicondylar surface development methodology can be used to develop a biomimetic knee joint capable of 3D motion.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-8786-3","10.1109/MERCon55799.2022.9906249","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906249","3D knee joint;bioinspired design;bicondytar surface","Fabrication;Three-dimensional displays;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Predictive models;Image capture;Trajectory","","1","","15","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
