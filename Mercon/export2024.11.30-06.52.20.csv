However, this centralization renders SDN vulnerable to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, posing critical security challenges. While existing studies explore attack vulnerabilities in SDN, they often suffer from limitations related to memory management and efficient detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel model that leverages the Light-Gradient Boost Machine (LGBM) algorithm, coupled with Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning. Our model achieves an exceptional average accuracy of 99.18% on the UNSW-15 dataset during both training and testing phases, surpassing existing models in terms of accuracy and training time.

The maritime industry is essential to the massive global movement of people and goods. Nonetheless, it is acknowledged that the maritime industry is responsible for $3 \%$ of the world’s greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions. The engine efficiencies of the modern marine ships are in the range of $30-45\%$, highlighting that $70 - 55 \%$ of the fuel energy is discharged as waste heat to the surrounding atmosphere by the engine cooling system and the exhaust system. Energy efficiency measures and stringent emission regulations have not been implemented in marine vessels and transport sector yet considering the cruise’s reliability and safety due to the operating environment. However, the scope and the use of maritime transportation sector is expanding rapidly around the clock due to economic consideration and globalization. As mentioned above, approximately $2 / 3^{\text {rd }}$ of the energy produced in the marine engines is wasted via the exhaust and the cooling system without being recovered. During the literature review, it was observed that theses mobile power plants used in maritime industry have not adopted waste heat recovery techniques adequately as much as the road transportation sector due to several reasons such that lack of attention to enhance the power train efficiency due to the lack of emission standards. Turbocharging, turbo-compounding, bottoming cycles (ORCs) and thermoelectric generation have been identified as the most promising and established energy recovery techniques that can be adopted to recover the waste heat and convert it to power in the marine vessels. However, no studies have been conducted to investigate waste heat recovery from marine engines using absorption chillers for air conditioning and passenger comfort in marine applications so far. Therefore, this study will investigate the applicability and possibility of exhaust energy recovery from absorption chillers to provide and handle the on-board cooling demand for thermal comfort applications. The study was conducted using the real engine data obtained from two classes of marine vessels (Hamilton class and Saryu class) use in Sri Lanka Navy. Results of the numerical analysis show that the heat which can be recovered from the main exhaust system of both classes of ships, is able to cater for the cooling load of the respective ship class. The analysis was performed based on $\mathrm{LiBr}_{\mathrm{aq}}$ absorption refrigeration, which will ensure the selected air conditioning system does not exhaust GHGs during the operation.","2691-364X","979-8-3315-2904-8","10.1109/MERCon63886.2024.10688594","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10688594","Diesel Engines;Exhaust Heat Recovery;Absorption Chillers;Maritime Transportation;Greenhouse Gases","Industries;Air conditioning;Absorption;Atmospheric measurements;Heat engines;Regulation;Waste heat;Marine vehicles;Heat recovery;Exhaust systems","","","","20","IEEE","30 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When calibrating the micro-aerated model, maximum specific growth rate for sulfur-reducing acetotrophic bacteria was altered to $0.38 \mathrm{~d}^{-1}$, switching function (which determines the minimum DO concentration at which oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur takes place) was altered to $0.0001 \mathrm{mgO}_{2} / \mathrm{L}$ and air was introduced to the system for 12 hours (after half an hour of feeding) at a rate of $0.018 \mathrm{~m}^{3} / \mathrm{hr}$ and another 12 hours at a rate of $0.015 \mathrm{~m}^{3} / \mathrm{hr}$. Although methane production improved over the first half of the micro-aerated time period, a negative impact of the presence of oxygen on methanogens could be evident when the oxygen presents in the system beyond 13 hours. The micro-aerated system shows a significant decrease in dissolved sulfides when compared to the anaerobic system.

Within the anaerobic digester, lipids are hydrolyzed into long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) and glycerol. LCFAs cause potential inhibitory effects significantly on acetoclastic methanogens and deteriorate digester performance. To study the impact of LCFA inhibition, the BioWin 6.2 integrated Anaerobic Sludge Digestion Model (ASDM) was extended with the lipid inhibition function. Out of the 7 kinetic constants used in the rate equations, maximum specific growth rates of acetate and lipids degraders, half saturation rate of acetate degraders and LCFA inhibition constant are the most sensitive parameters toward methane production. The calibrated model with lipid inhibition (Model 2) showed a higher negative impact on COD reduction, acetoclastic methanogen concentration, and methane production compared to model without lipid inhibition (Model 1), indicating a significant impact of lipid inhibition on anaerobic digestion. If Model 1 is used to simulate anaerobic digestion of lipid rich wastewater, deviations between the actual results and the model predicted results will be high. Thus, Model 2 can be used as a tool to predict the COD reduction, effect on the acetoclastic methanogens, and methane production in anaerobic digestion, which utilizes lipid-rich wastewater.","2691-364X","979-8-3315-2904-8","10.1109/MERCon63886.2024.10688509","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10688509","lipid inhibition;LCFA;anaerobic digestion;BioWin;simulation","Methane;Biological system modeling;Production;Predictive models;Lipidomics;Mathematical models;Kinetic theory;Wastewater","","","","20","IEEE","30 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research paper presents the machine learning methodology for the detection and classification of body shaming phrases. The standard TF-IDF has been employed for feature extraction. The SVM classifier exhibited an exceptional accuracy of $\mathbf{98.5\%}$. In order to improve performance and address the issue of overfitting, the dataset is subjected to resampling procedures, which are carefully applied to ensure the appropriate selection of the model. The methodology encompasses four resampling strategies for achieving data balance, namely SMOTE, ADASYN, SMOTE-Tomek and SMOTE-ENN. The efficacy of the suggested methodology is evaluated by comparing it against five machine learning classifiers, The findings suggest that SVM exhibit superior performance compared to other models in both the SMOTE and SMOTE-Tomek balanced datasets. Specifically, SVM achieves accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score scores of $\mathbf{99.1\%, 99.59\%,} \mathbf{99.18\%}$, and $\mathbf{99.38\%}$ respectively.

Global satellite rainfall estimates offer advantages in mitigating scale discrepancies and overcoming the critical requirement of reliable rainfall data sources in regions with limited ground-based observations for hydrological studies. This study comprehensively analyses the applicability of high-resolution satellite rainfall estimates (SREs) for surface runoff modeling. The efficacy of satellite estimates necessitates rigorous evaluation due to intrinsic biases, requiring bias correction. Hydrological simulations conducted using bias-corrected SREs reveal significant differences in model performance, emphasizing the importance of accurate rainfall inputs for reliable streamflow predictions. Overall, this research addresses the research gap in utilizing satellite rainfall estimates for hydrological modeling, particularly in regions with diverse terrain conditions and tropical monsoonal climates. CHIRPS, AgERA5, and PERSIANN rainfall estimates were selected considering their applicability in recent research studies. CHIRPS and AgERA5 rainfall estimates follow the monsoonal climate signal within the Maha Oya basin, fitting to ground-based rainfall observations. Further, CHIRPS estimates generate the best runoff simulations compared to other SREs, resulting in coefficient of determination of 0.53 and 0.57 for model calibration and validation.","2691-364X","979-8-3315-2904-8","10.1109/MERCon63886.2024.10689062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10689062","HEC-HMS;Satellite Rainfall Estimates;Streamflow simulation;Tropical River Basin","Rain;Satellites;Accuracy;Chirp;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Data models;Surface fitting;Surface topography;Rivers","","","","20","IEEE","30 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sieve analysis and modified direct shear tests were conducted on soil samples to analyse the shear strength characteristics of the soil-concrete interface. Image analysis was used to determine the morphological parameters such as angularity, roughness, sphericity, and roundness, and correlations were developed to predict the shear behaviour. When comparing the coefficient of uniformity $\left(C_{u}\right)$ values of the quarry dust, river sand, and sea sand samples, it was identified that higher $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{u}}$ values correspond to higher friction angles and interface friction angles. The friction angle has increased by 4.7% and 15.6%, respectively, at the soil interface and the soil + concrete interface when the $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{u}}$ value rises. Additionally, an increase in particle sizes increases the shear strength of samples. For instance, for a normal stress of 150 kPa, when the particle size increases from 0.075 mm to 2.36 mm, the shear strength increases by 21.2%. Further, the angular-shaped quarry dust particles exhibit an enhanced friction angle and interface friction angle by 10.8% and 12.4%, respectively, with an increase in angularity from 1.091 to 1.122, compared to spherical or rounded particles. Additionally, with an increase in regularity from 0.76 to 0.81, the interface friction angle decreased from $27.4^{0}$ to $24.8^{0}$, and the friction angle decreased from $32.4^{0}$ to $28.9^{0}$, marking percentage decreases of 9.7% and 11.0%, respectively. These findings underscore the crucial role of particle morphology in influencing the shear behaviour of quarry dust + concrete, sea sand + concrete, and river sand + concrete interfaces, with implications for the design and construction of geotechnical structures.","2691-364X","979-8-3315-2904-8","10.1109/MERCon63886.2024.10688730","University of Moratuwa; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10688730","interface shear behaviour;particle size;gradation;particle shape;image analysis","Sea surface;Shape;Friction;Surface resistance;Surface morphology;Morphology;Soil;Rivers;Stress;Standards","","","","11","IEEE","30 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among domes, grid shells redistribute materials into lattice members, creating structural depth. Despite their popularity, using structural optimization to find efficient shapes for grid shells remains under-explored. This paper introduces a novel framework to optimize the form-finding process of deep dome-type grid-shell structures using topology and size optimization. Initially, a deep grid-shell structure and load type are defined. An equivalent continuous shell structure undergoes optimization to minimize strain energy and find the optimal grid arrangement. This arrangement is used for size optimization to determine optimal member sizes. Finally, a linear elastic analysis compares the structural performance of the initial gridshell, the topology-optimized continuous shell, and the structural optimization-inspired grid-shell. A case study of a shell subjected to a ring load is presented. Results show significant improvements in material efficiency and structural performance, with optimized designs achieving higher buckling capacities and reduced stresses and displacements. Future work will explore the complexity of topology optimization for shallow versus deep shells and include plastic analyses for large deformations and material yielding, aiming to enhance realistic assessments.","2691-364X","979-8-3315-2904-8","10.1109/MERCon63886.2024.10688825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10688825","deep domes;grid-shells;topology optimization;form-finding;size optimization;buckling capacity","Structural rings;Shape;Lattices;Topology;Structural engineering;Plastics;Optimization;Stress;Strain;Gravity","","","","21","IEEE","30 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

High $\Delta T$ systems operates with higher temperature difference between supply and return chilled water temperatures compared to conventional low $\Delta T$ systems. This high $\Delta T$ requirement is specified in the ASHRAE 90.1: 2016 under subsection 6.5.4. “Chilled Water coil selection and theoretical background of temperature difference towards energy efficiency”. Hence, the aim of the study is to evaluate the capital cost reduction and annual energy savings achievable through the implementation of high $\Delta T$ configurations and to evaluate the applicability of this configuration in hot and humid countries. The study followed a comprehensive research methodology that involved analyzing 03 chilled water ΔT options and assessing their impact on capital costs and energy consumption. The findings of the study demonstrate significant cost savings and energy efficiencies associated with high $\Delta T$ chilled water designs. A capital cost reduction of 2.8% in the $\Delta T=7^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ system and 3.6% in the $\Delta T=8.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ systems were observed compared to the conventional $\Delta T=5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ system. Additionally, the annual energy analysis revealed a 0.97% reduction of energy costs in the $\Delta T=7^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ system and a higher energy cost saving of 1.93% in the $\Delta T=8.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ system compared to the $\Delta T=5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ system. These findings highlight the potential benefits of adopting high $\Delta T$ chilled water designs in office buildings. The results not only demonstrate cost-effectiveness but also underscore the importance of energy efficiency and sustainability in building design and operation. The outcomes of this study contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the field and provide valuable insights for building professionals and stakeholders seeking optimal cooling system solutions.

Consequently, many earlier drought analysis studies were limited to a narrow geographic area and a single drought index. This study aims to use multiple remote sensing parameters to provide a more comprehensive analysis of droughts in the Padiyathalawa catchment area, a dry zone river basin in Sri Lanka. Three satellite-derived indices, namely the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), and Standardized Precipitation (SP), were integrated using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique to derive a Combined Drought Index (CDI). The impact of spatially distributed drought on variations in river flow was further evaluated by employing the Hydrologic Engineering Center’s Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) rainfall-runoff model, configured as a semi-distributed model with five (5) sub-catchments. The CDI analysis shows dry conditions from June to August and wetter periods influenced by the northeast monsoon. The developed CDI displayed a correlation with streamflow but requires refinement to reflect streamflow dynamics accurately during high rainfall events. While the HEC-HMS model effectively simulated streamflow (NSE = 0.78-0.92), limitations emerged in low-flow simulation, particularly when the discharge was below $0.1 \mathrm{~m}^{3} / \mathrm{sec}$. The drought-prone areas identified by the CDI were further analyzed using the HEC-HMS with a set of hypothetical drought scenarios. It was found that river flow reduces with increased drought severity and its effect reduces when the sub-catchment is further from the catchment outlet. This study highlights the potential of integrating remote sensing data, PCA, and hydrological modeling for drought assessment. The methodology and the results of this study can be used in formulating adaptation measures to reduce drought impacts.","2691-364X","979-8-3315-2904-8","10.1109/MERCon63886.2024.10688589","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10688589","combined drought index;HEC-HMS;principal component analysis;TCI;VCI","Temperature sensors;Adaptation models;Rain;Droughts;Vegetation mapping;Data models;Rivers;Indexes;Remote sensing;Principal component analysis","","","","13","IEEE","30 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing modern localization systems, while sophisticated, often come with considerable costs and limitations in accessibility. Recognizing the need for a more accessible solution, there is a growing demand for user-friendly and cost-effective alternatives. One such alternative lies in leveraging mobile devices for localization. However, relying solely on Global Positioning System (GPS), Wi-Fi, or cellular networks, the most commonly used technologies in mobile device localization, often suffer from issues with accuracy. Addressing these drawbacks is crucial to ensuring its effectiveness and widespread adoption. Map matching is a commonly pursued and well-researched approach taken to rectify these erroneous location data. This paper presents the implementation of a hybrid of two map-matching implementations on a mobile device with minimal reliance on external sensory devices: an on-device map-matching algorithm that utilizes a customizable underlying map when internet connectivity is unavailable, and an open-source Valhalla routing service when the internet is available. This hybrid localization model can be utilized in many driver-assistance mobile applications that require precise vehicle location and has shown promising results during experimentation.","2691-364X","979-8-3315-2904-8","10.1109/MERCon63886.2024.10689130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10689130","vehicular localization;map-matching;GPS;driver assistance;mobile device;android;Valhalla;Amazon Web Services (AWS)","Location awareness;Accuracy;Web services;Routing;Mobile handsets;Mobile applications;Wireless fidelity;Global Positioning System;Vehicles;Testing","","","","19","IEEE","30 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study assesses the spatial autocorrelation of impervious surface cover and high-temperature zoning in the North Central Province of Sri Lanka using a SAR-based Built-Up Index (BUI) coupled with Sentinel-2 optical imagery indices.

The analysis reveals spatial anomalies in LST spread near the outskirts of urban areas, water bodies, and green patches, suggesting potential spatial propagation patterns.

Transbasin water transfers offer a sustainable solution, mitigating uneven water distribution by redirecting surplus water to deficit areas. This study focused on the impact of climate change on water resources and the applicability of trans-basin water transfer in Sri Lanka’s dry zone. Future precipitation and temperature data were generated using the CNRM-CM6-1-HR model, downscaled with LARS-WG software. Projected inflow to the Huruluwewa reservoir was simulated using HEC-HMS software. The study shows that trans-basin water transfer reduced the water deficit from 20.7 MCM to 4.2 MCM during the 2018-2019 water year. Findings indicate an expected increase in annual rainfall by 6.4% and 5.5% during the 2030-2049 period under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively. Both monsoonal rainfall patterns show an upward trend under these scenarios. However, projections indicate a decreasing trend in monthly average rainfall during the dry season, suggesting even drier future conditions. Rising temperatures will lead to higher evapotranspiration rates, resulting in a projected 27% decrease in annual inflow to the reservoir.

Meanwhile, global freshwater scarcity has been aggravated by conventional concrete production methods. In this case, seawater presents a promising alternative due to its abundance. Currently, it is prohibited to use seawater in reinforced concrete according to industry regulations due to its corrosive nature. Therefore, this study investigates the viability of utilizing seawater for both the mixing and curing of unreinforced concrete. The experimental study has mainly focused on the effect of seawater on curing unreinforced concrete and the effect of seawater on both making and curing unreinforced concrete comparing the properties of fresh concrete (slump, slump loss) and mechanical properties of hardened concrete (compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, drying shrinkage). Findings reveal that while seawater mixing exerts an insignificant impact on the slump but induces increased slump loss, seawater curing also demonstrates an insignificant effect on hardened concrete properties. Moreover, mechanical performance displays notable variation between seawater and freshwater concrete. Based on the results the paper concludes that the use of seawater for curing unreinforced concrete is recommended. Finally, some other recommendations for further studies are also provided based on laboratory trials.","2691-364X","979-8-3315-2904-8","10.1109/MERCon63886.2024.10688505","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10688505","fresh properties;hardened properties;seawater concrete;seawater curing","Workability;Industries;Production;Curing;Concrete;Regulation;Freshwater","","","","14","IEEE","30 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The effect of particle loading was analyzed on the viscosity, thermal conductivity (TC) and stability of nanofluid. The results show that the nanofluids beyond mass loading of 0.5 wt% of GO/prGO show poor stability. prGO was found to be more effective in enhancing the TC of the nanofluid, due to enhanced TC of the prGO particles. TC enhancement of nanofluids up to 30% was achieved, with the highest increment shown by the nanofluid with $0.75 \mathrm{wt} \%$ prGO. Furthermore, the thermal transport characteristics of the nanofluids were computationally modelled using finite element analysis. The average convection heat transfer coefficient (CHC) of $0.5 \mathrm{wt} \%$ prGO-based nanofluid showed a 52% increment, highlighting the effectiveness of prGO-based nanofluids. Importantly, the nanofluids with particle concentrations below $0.5 \mathrm{wt} \%$ show performance enhancement ratio (PER) values suitable for practical applications.

This study attempts to reduce this gap by exploring the sustainable cement types utilised in the construction industry and investigating their performance in concrete. The aim is to determine the critical factors that affect concrete quality when using blended cement and to investigate the attitudes & actions of the construction industry towards sustainable cement adoption. The study employs a methodology that involves performing experiments on three distinct grades of blended cement and conducting a field survey to gather feedback from industry professionals.

The results demonstrate that the initial bending stiffness of curved-crease specimens with a low crease radius is lower but becomes higher at the maximum folded state compared to specimens with a high crease radius. Additionally, it can be observed that the contribution of the unrestrained half of the specimen significantly increases the bending stiffness of a curved crease specimen during the folding motion for lower crease radius, whereas the contribution remains almost constant for higher crease radius. Numerical models of curved creases, developed using the commercial software Abaqus and incorporating straight crease characteristics, accurately estimate experimental reaction forces, indicating that the characteristics of straight creases can be used in modeling curved creases.","2691-364X","979-8-3315-2904-8","10.1109/MERCon63886.2024.10689071","Ministry of Education; University of Moratuwa; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10689071","crease radius;crease stiffness;elastica curves;finite element modeling","Accuracy;Shape;Estimation;Bending;Software;Numerical models;Printers;Antenna arrays;Design optimization","","","","13","IEEE","30 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Hydrologic Engineering Center’s Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) was used to simulate streamflow under rainfall scenarios varying up to ±15%. Drought conditions were categorized using specific percentile thresholds into four levels: extreme, severe, moderate, and mild. Results show that a modest annual rainfall variation of 5% can significantly alter drought conditions, highlighting the hydrological sensitivity of the basin. Increased precipitation improved moderate drought conditions, demonstrating the resilience of the basin, while decreased rainfall exacerbates drought severity. Transitions of drought categories were observed with varying rainfall amounts, suggesting that even minor changes can lead to significant shifts in drought severity.

However, limited research has been conducted on suitable wave energy converter (WEC) types under local wave conditions. This study analysed the performances of two main WEC types: Heaving Point Absorber (HPA) and Oscillating Wave Surge Converter (OWSC) in a sea location near Matara, a southern coastal area of Sri Lanka. The HPA performance was evaluated using a conventional cylindrical buoy and a novel super cuboid shape, which was found more efficient in previous studies. Similarly, for the OWSC, conventional rectangular flap was compared with a novel concaved flap geometry, also previously proven to be more efficient. The analysis employed Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) numerical simulations, with 266 simulations conducted under various operational conditions, including damping coefficients, Buoy Height to Wave Height Ratio (BHWHR), and buoy or flap widths. Results indicated that using a super cuboid buoy and concaved flap could increase the capture width ratio (CWR) by up to 25% compared to conventional geometries. The study concludes that HPA-type WECs are the best candidates for local wave conditions, considering CWR, hydrodynamic forces, and directional variations of the waves.","2691-364X","979-8-3315-2904-8","10.1109/MERCon63886.2024.10689032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10689032","capture width ratio;hydrodynamic forces;owsc;point absorber;wave energy converter geometry","Geometry;Damping;Renewable energy sources;Shape;Sea measurements;Hydrodynamics;Numerical simulation;Numerical models;Wave energy conversion;Surges","","","","20","IEEE","30 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Three typical initial imperfections, namely V-shape, C-shape, and W-shape have been identified based on field studies in the literature regarding geometrical imperfection shapes in extended bolted end-plate connections. This study explores the effect of C-shape and V-shape imperfections on the rotational stiffness of stainless-steel end-plate connections, specifically focusing on connections with six bolts. A validated numerical model was used to investigate the impact of initial imperfection on rotational stiffness. The results indicate that the initial rotational stiffness of the connection decreases with an increase in initial imperfection. Further, the V-shape has the least influence, while the C-shape significantly influences the initial rotational stiffness. For V-shape imperfections, its influence on the stiffness of the connections is negligible as long as the imperfection is limited to the criterion of (end plate depth)/300. In the case of a C-shape imperfection, its influence on the rotational stiffness would be substantial, even if it satisfies the requirement of the imperfection limit. According to the results, even the presence of a 0.5 mm C-shaped imperfection decreased the rotational stiffness by 8.9%.

To generate maps for the future, gridded rainfall datasets were developed using Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation (CHIRPS) satellite data under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios, specifically SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 projection scenarios. The bias correction for CHIRPS satellite data was performed using a non-linear power transformation approach while the mean-based method was used for the bias correction of Global Climate Model data. Then the Standardized Precipitation Index at a three-month scale was used to estimate meteorological drought conditions. According to the results, the basin is more vulnerable to moderate droughts in the 2015-2100period under the SSP1-2.6 scenario. The occurrence of severe droughts in the middle part of the basin is significant under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. Additionally, the frequency of occurrence of extreme droughts is projected to increase by more than 35% under both projection scenarios.

Through a series of experimental tests conducted under interior two-flange loading conditions, the research evaluated the resistance of these beams to web crippling. The beams with different curvatures, including both flanges inward and outward-curved were systematically analysed to understand their impact on web crippling resistance. The findings indicate that the web crippling capacity is significantly affected by the initial curvature. Notably, the flange inward curvature enhances the web crippling capacity, whereas the flange outward curvature diminishes it compared to straight, unlipped channel sections. Furthermore, the design guidelines commonly used for predicting web crippling capacity were evaluated for consistency and reliability compared to the experimental results.

Furthermore, we employ a bell-shaped passband for the ideal magnitude response for the design compared to a conventional ideal frequency response that employs 1 and 0 as the passband and the stopband gains with a finite transition band.

We propose a multi-modal chatbot that is customised and designed to assist users with communication disabilities in navigating a website. Unlike typical chatbots, which rely on one form of communication, our architecture combines multiple modalities to improve comprehension and promote effective communication for people with Aphasia. We focus on gathering multimodal inputs by recognising and combining user intents from diverse sources. The use of Txtai, an all-in-one embeddings database for semantic search improves our chatbot’s capacity to process various inputs efficiently. We leverage specialised models like Whisper for audio transcription and MediaPipe Gesture Recognizer for gesture detection to enhance user interactions.

The primary aim is to develop an RCC with improved performance compared to existing methods while exploring the potential for enhancing hydration and achieving higher strength results with minimum cement content. The research focuses on evaluating the suitability of clay tile waste as an ICA and examines the mechanical and durability properties of RCC samples containing clay tile aggregates (CTA) at varying replacement percentages (2.5%, 5%, and 7.5%). Results indicate that a 2.5% replacement of coarse aggregates with clay tile waste enhances early compressive and flexural strength development, with tensile strength comparable to control samples. However, diminishing trends in compressive, flexural, and tensile strength are observed beyond this ratio, attributed to the lower inherent strength of CTA.

However, hospitals themselves are high-risk locations for disastrous events due to factors such as a vulnerable population. Therefore, efficient planning of disaster risk reduction measures, including effective evacuation planning, is essential to ensure the resilience of a hospital. Evacuation simulations are widely used to understand complex human behavior and effectively plan evacuation procedures. This study presents a pioneering step in evacuation simulation for Sri Lankan hospitals. AnyLogic, an agent-based simulation software, is used to evaluate how the physical environment of a general hospital ward affects different evacuation scenarios, assessing safe evacuation times and identifying congested locations by considering additional parameters like crowd density and corridor width. The findings suggest that providing additional emergency exits to facilitate crowd movement is more effective than relying on crowd control techniques administered by hospital staff. Moreover, the study underscores the significance of designing corridors with adequate width to support crowd evacuation during emergencies. Additionally, this study discusses the strengths and limitations of the current research, providing insights for future studies in evacuation simulations for Sri Lankan hospitals.","2691-364X","979-8-3315-2904-8","10.1109/MERCon63886.2024.10688750","University of Moratuwa; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10688750","evacuation simulation;agent-based modeling;Sri Lankan hospitals;human behavior modeling","Hospitals;Disasters;Buildings;Decision making;Psychology;Software;Planning;Critical infrastructure;Object recognition;Resilience","","","","36","IEEE","30 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Activities ranging from high-intensity workouts to casual lounging can lead to the formation of sweat patches on garments, detracting from their aesthetic appeal. These patches often result due to an imbalance in the sweat evaporation and absorption rates. To address this issue, a novel approach has been introduced that utilizes an optimized yarn combination and innovative knitted structures, integrating effective moisture management with water repellency within the same fabric. Specifically, weft-knitted spacer fabric structures have been developed to facilitate sweat evaporation from targeted areas of the fabric. Variations of the primary structure were fine-tuned to enhance sweat patch visibility reduction. The results obtained by MMT (Moisture Management Tester) revealed a notable difference between the developed fabric variations. As maximum wetted radius being the most crucial attribute to measure the sweat patch visibility reduction, only one fabric sample out of the variations provide the desired results with the wetted radius being 10 mm while obtaining a grade of 2. Consequently, with a low wetting time and high spreading speeds the structure demonstrates a favorable behavior in terms of wearer comfort.","2691-364X","979-8-3315-2904-8","10.1109/MERCon63886.2024.10689100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10689100","sweat patches;spacer textile structure;water repellency;wetted radius;athleisure wear;weft knitted fabrics","Absorption;Clothing;Moisture;Focusing;Fabrics;Skin;Distance measurement;Evaporation;Yarn","","","","7","IEEE","30 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fleece, made completely of recycled polyester, is considered the optimal selection for the wicking layer because of its outstanding one-way conveyance, wicking rate, and breathability.

This paper presents a robust fuzzy-based integration of active steering with torque vectoring in order to achieve vehicle yaw stability. A single-track vehicle model is used to mathematically model the vehicle, accommodating the active front steering and torque vectoring systems. A fuzzy logic controller is employed to calculate the required corrective steering and differential torque based on the error in yaw rate. The implementation of this system is carried out using MATLAB. Furthermore, an analysis of the effect of the proportion of corrective assistance given by active front steering and torque vectoring is done. The results indicate enhanced vehicle manoeuvrability during cornering, as evidenced by the near alignment of the measured yaw rate with the desired values. The simulations are carried out for two speeds where the effect of the controller was shown significant for both cases. The normalised root mean square error is reducing from 10% to 3.94% in $60 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ case and from 12.9% to 4.01% in $100 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ case.

This design introduces a novel seating function that can be used as a conventional wheelchair. It also includes an innovatively designed seat to enhance patient comfort during transfer and transport. In addition to this, the design integrates a specialized Stand Assistive Device to assist patients in standing and sitting. It includes several user-friendly features, a parallelogram mechanism that ensures that the user stays upright during the process and a lower limb locking mechanism to ensure stability. It also incorporates low physical strain to the caregiver providing a safe and feasible operation. An experiment was conducted to observe the path of the shoulder joint during assisted standing. The results obtained by this was integrated into the kinematic analysis of the Stand Assist Device. A kinetic analysis of the user and the Stand Assist device is presented in the paper. A functional prototype, incorporating several safety features, was fabricated and tested by four healthy users with varying anthropometric data.","2691-364X","979-8-3315-2904-8","10.1109/MERCon63886.2024.10688957","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10688957","assisted sit-to-stand;chair transfer;reconfigurable seat;wheeled systems","Wheelchairs;Shoulder;Prototypes;Manuals;Kinematics;Stability analysis;Safety;Kinetic theory;Usability;Strain","","","","20","IEEE","30 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Ultra Low-Complexity 4-D IIR Hyperfan Filter for Light Field Denoising","N. Satheeskanth; C. Wijenayake; C. U. S.

Most of LF denoising methods have higher computational complexities despite excellent performance. Denoising of LFs using 4-D linear filters is a low-complexity approach that can achieve near real-time or real-time processing. We propose an ultra low-complexity LF denoising methods using 4-D infinite-extent impulse response (IIR) hyperfan filters in this paper. Our approach exploits the sparsity of an LF in the 4-D frequency domain, and employ a set of one-dimensional and two-dimensional first-order IIR filters to approximate the 4-D hyperfan-shaped passband. On average, the proposed 4-D IIR hyperfan filter needs only 2.56 multiplications and 21.06 additions to process a LF sample leading to more than 92% and 64% savings in the number of multiplications and additions to process a LF sample compared previously proposed LF denoising methods based on 4-D linear filters with a $\sim 1 \mathrm{~dB}$ deterioration in the peak-signal-to-noise ratio.","2691-364X","979-8-3315-2904-8","10.1109/MERCon63886.2024.10688959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10688959","Denoising;IIR filters;4-D filters;light fields;low complexity","Maximum likelihood detection;Frequency-domain analysis;Noise reduction;IIR filters;Nonlinear filters;Real-time systems;Light fields;Passband;Computational complexity","","","","37","IEEE","30 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The study proposes a systematic approach to extend textile lifespan by repurposing textile offcuts effectively. The research aims to evaluate offcuts for creating quality garments to reduce waste, increase textile longevity, and promote sustainability. The research primarily adds value in two ways. First, it established a method to recognize offcut-friendly garment designs by utilizing designers’ expertise based on the common offcut shapes generated. Second, a computational method and tools are presented to evaluate the usability of offcuts to design new garment styles that are conducive to utilizing those offcuts. The study shows how these computational approaches can smoothly integrate into manufacturing processes. The methodology focuses on analyzing computerized markers to find suitable offcut fabrics for new garments. Key phases include offcut usability analysis, designing new garment designs, evaluating technical feasibility, and system testing and validations. Finally, based on results and findings, the research confirms and technically validates that clothing made from offcut fabrics are wearable, using modern validation methods. Overall, this finalizes a comprehensive method to implement technically feasible sustainable apparel design and manufacturing.","2691-364X","979-8-3315-2904-8","10.1109/MERCon63886.2024.10689126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10689126","offcuts made garments;sustainable apparel designs;cutting and packing;technical feasibility;virtual reality for sustainable apparel;virtual prototyping;genetic algorithm","System testing;Systematics;Manufacturing processes;Shape;Clothing;Fabrics;Manufacturing;Usability;Sustainable development","","","","18","IEEE","30 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
