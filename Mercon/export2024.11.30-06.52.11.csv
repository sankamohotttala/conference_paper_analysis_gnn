Hence, a suitable hardware based implementation is necessary to manage such data efficiently. We formulated a scanning mechanism for a large piezoresistive sensor array using a Xilinx Zynq device and custom developed RTL modules. The zynq device acts as the brain of the scanning mechanism issuing control signals and acquiring ADC readings. Therefore, we developed a scanning mechanism using a combination of Xilinx standard IP cores and custom made RTL modules, and deployed it in a zynq device. Performance of the implemented mechanism depends primarily on the developed adc 0 module. It inherits bulk of the functionality of the developed system. Hence, behavioral simulations were conducted on Vivado design suite with respect to data buffering capability, control signal issuance, data alignment and transmission for the adc_0 module. Subsequent overall analysis conducted on the system indicated that the developed system is efficiently functioning.","2691-364X","979-8-3503-4521-6","10.1109/MERCon60487.2023.10355457","National Science Foundation of Sri Lanka; University of Moratuwa; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10355457","piezoresistive sensor array;re-configurable hardware;readout circuit;System on Chip (SoC)","Performance evaluation;Simulation;Data acquisition;Behavioral sciences;Performance analysis;IP networks;Piezoresistance","","","","13","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Ginigalpelessa serpentinite deposit in Sri Lanka contains high concentrations of Ni, Cr, and Co where the phytomining potential is not well-documented. Therefore, the present study determines Ni, Cr, and Co contents in the soil and assesses the relationship between Ni content and plant diversity to identify potential areas for phytomining in the deposit. Thirty-one soil and twenty-five rock samples were collected from the deposit to analyze their metal contents. The abundant plant species were recorded at each location to analyze the plant diversity and species evenness using the Shannon Weiner Diversity Index. Based on soil analysis, Ni concentration in Ginigalpelessa serpentine soil ranged from 4,005 to 17,352 mg/kg which is within the range of global Ni phytomining grade (6,000 - 12,000 mg/kg). Moreover, areas having low diversity (0.0919 - 0.3061) showed high enrichment of Ni (7,000 - 12,000 mg/kg), emphasizing that low diversity areas with high Ni-enriched soils are suitable for in-situ Ni phytomining.

Several studies have attempted various analyses of the game, such as predicting the likelihood of a team's victory, analyzing individual player performances and forecasting scores. However, forecasting scores has not been studied extensively and limited to specific teams, rather than a generalized approach. Our paper presents a generalised novel deep neural network-based method to predict the score of the first innings in a T20 international cricket match. The model utilizes various attributes in three categories namely a) current status of the match b) performance of the current batsmen and c) performance of the bowler and provides predictions for each over.

The external environment is always unsteady; therefore, the dynamics of boomerangs should be studied in unsteady wind conditions. The main aim of this research is to study the steady and unsteady wind effects on the boomerang trajectory by developing an unsteady input-based mathematical model. A traditional ‘V’ shape boomerang is designed using CATIA V5, and 2D steady state ANSYS Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulation (CFD) was performed to derive the aero dynamical coefficients of the boomerang. Finally, the newly developed mathematical model is numerically simulated using MATLAB. The trajectory of the boomerang in different wind conditions is plotted and compared. The results show that the steady and unsteady wind highly influences the boomerang path.

The increasing trend of pandemics and the long-lasting struggle it create with unpredicted consumer demand and behaviors necessitate the identification of solutions for sudden demand fluctuations during a disruption. The study addresses the absence of quantitative models in the Sri Lankan context to mitigate disruptions in the demand for fast-moving consumer goods caused by pandemics. The results highlight a substantial difference between the aggregate consumption of ""Personal Care"" and ""Home Care"" commodities before and after the pandemic. A literature review identified 23 factors that influence demand disruption during a pandemic globally. Then, validated factors for the Sri Lankan context and assessed using Grey relational analysis. The results highlight inflation, consumer wages, prices, and government regulations have a significant impact on disrupting demand during a pandemic in Sri Lanka. The Grey model with 2-AGO is the most suitable model to manage demand disruptions of ‘Personal Care’ and ‘Home Care’ commodities during a pandemic when compared to traditional time series models. The results will assist companies in managing demand disruptions with rapid demand forecasts and taking precautionary actions against fluctuating influencing factors.","2691-364X","979-8-3503-4521-6","10.1109/MERCon60487.2023.10355466","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10355466","Time Series;COVID-19;Personal and Home Care;Grey Prediction Model;Grey Relational Analysis","Analytical models;Fluctuations;Pandemics;Time series analysis;Government;Predictive models;Market research","","","","30","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Music applications continuously strive to enhance their recommendation systems to ensure that users have an exceptional listening experience and remain loyal to their platform.In the early days, the recommendation system used collaborative filtering and content-based approaches to achieve this goal, but these approaches have an issue with a cold start, and context awareness of these approaches is less. Researchers identified in the context of the personalization of songs, Emotion, and mood can play a luge role. Research has shown that a user’s current emotional state significantly influences their musical preferences in the short term. Therefore, the recommendation system moves toward mood-based recommendation approaches. The vast variety and context-dependent character of the data that must be considered present the main difficulty for mood-based recommendation systems.

This change brings new challenges to the power grid because of its variable and intermittent nature. One of the main issues is voltage violations and PV curtailment. A smart inverter (SI) provides a fast response method to regulate the voltage by varying real or reactive power at the point of common coupling (PCC). When multiple SIs operate under an autonomous control scheme, the reactive power level exceeds the threshold level. This creates an undesirable situation in the system. This paper mainly considers the coordination of the SI using a deep reinforcement learning algorithm (DRL). The DRL agent learns the policy through interaction with the IEEE-37 test feeder in the OpenDSS simulation to find out the optimal action. By defining the rewards scheme of the action carefully, the reactive power of SI can be utilized optimally, and the PV voltage will be maintained within the normal operating zone. Validation of the DRL agent’s performance is done with the local autonomous control scheme. The results assure that a well-trained DRL agent can coordinate multiple SIs for voltage regulation and PV curtailment reduction.","2691-364X","979-8-3503-4521-6","10.1109/MERCon60487.2023.10355465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10355465","Deep Reinforcement learning;Smart inverters;Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient;photovoltaic;Voltage regulation and PV curtailment","Training;Photovoltaic systems;Deep learning;Reactive power;Reinforcement learning;Silicon;Inverters","","","","21","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Potential changes in future rainfall regimes were projected using the HadGEM3-GC31-LL model from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Coarse-resolution rainfall from this model was statistically downscaled to the meteorological station level using the Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator, known as LARS-WG.

This study investigated the importance of groundwater gradient as a triggering factor along with six other influencing factors belonging to four groups: topography, geological conditions, hydrological environment, and human engineering activities for landslide susceptibility in the Kegalle District area in Sri Lanka. The groundwater flow model was developed using the USGS modular finite-difference flow model (MODFLOW), and the spatial distribution of hydraulic gradient was estimated over a 1,523 km$^{2}$ area. The estimated hydraulic gradient was then combined with slope, elevation, distance from the river, rainfall, land use, and soil texture for landslide susceptibility analysis using the analytical hierarchy process. The study area is divided into five groups, from low to high risk of susceptibilities. The results show a 60%-75% match between landslides that occurred in the past and the categories with extreme hydraulic gradients.

In this study, 33 years (1960-1980 and 2006-2018) streamflow data of the Tangi Gharoo watershed in the Kabul River basin have been studied for inconsistency checking and streamflow threshold determination. Thresholds are established through the assessment of the consistent streamflow segments and the average slope of the flow duration curve. The results of data checking revealed minor irregularities, while the data gap between 1980 to 2006 affected the shape of the flow duration curve. The findings indicated a descending trend in annual streamflow, with the highest streamflow during spring in 1965 and the lowest streamflow during summer in 2018. The low flow threshold is determined to be 87.3% with a corresponding streamflow magnitude of 0.09 mm/month (0.44 m3/s) while the high flow threshold is 7.84% with a corresponding streamflow magnitude of 7.01 mm/month (34.7 m3/s), in a monthly temporal resolution.

The study was mainly concerned with determining the consistency, setting time, workability, compressive strength, and split tensile strength of concrete mixes containing different percentages of SCBA. Three replacement scenarios were considered into account: $0\%\mathrm{SCBA}$ (control sample), $5\%\mathrm{SCBA}$, and $ 10\% SCBA$, which would have replaced both $OPC$ and $PCC$. Various tests were conducted according to relevant standards to evaluate the performance of the concrete mixes. The results revealed that replacing $ 10\%$ of OPC with SCBA performed better than replacing $PCC$ and the control samples. Higher compressive strength and split tensile strength were among the improved mechanical characteristics of the concrete mixtures with $ 10\%$ SCBA. These results show the possibility of using SCBA as a partial cement substitute to enhance the overall performance of concrete, especially when replacing OPC. This research offers important insights into sustainable construction practices by identifying SCBA as a feasible cementitious material with favorable economic and environmental effects. The results may assist researchers and concrete experts in optimizing the use of SCBA in concrete mix designs to achieve desired mechanical properties and enhance sustainability in the construction industry.","2691-364X","979-8-3503-4521-6","10.1109/MERCon60487.2023.10355504","Asian Development Bank; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10355504","Sugarcane bagasse ash;Concrete;Cement composites;Mechanical properties","Workability;Economics;Ash;Concrete;Sustainable development;Standards;Construction industry","","","","20","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper entails the details of work focusing on building a design framework for subsonic low-speed (wind speeds less than a Mach number of 0.3) wind tunnels with a medium-scale test section, which reduces the mathematical modelling and analysis required in designing a wind tunnel from scratch, and in turn, reduces the cost. The approach to building the design framework is based on non-dimensional parameters of the component geometry. In order to obtain the most optimum non-dimensional parameters for each critical component (mainly contraction and diffuser), a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis followed by a MOGA (Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm) design optimization is performed using the ANSYS software package. A combined model of contraction, test section and diffuser is optimized using ANSYS DesignXplorer, governed by objectives set for an optimum flow condition in the test section. In the optimization process, flow simulations are done through ANSYS FLUENT. Using the resulting optimum non-dimensional parameters, a database is developed for different test section dimensions in the medium-scale range. The database is then fed into an online platform (https://blk-vol1-2f260.web.app/) where users can obtain complete design specifications for the wind tunnel by entering the required wind speed and test section dimensions.","2691-364X","979-8-3503-4521-6","10.1109/MERCon60487.2023.10355478","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10355478","Design Framework;Subsonic Low-Speed Wind Tunnel;Computational Fluid Dynamics;ANSYS FLUENT;MOGA Optimization","Costs;Databases;Software packages;Wind tunnels;Wind speed;Computational fluid dynamics;Buildings","","","","17","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A series of accurate land cover maps play a crucial role in capturing extreme hazard events. There are multiple remotely sensed LC products available today, yet the absence of a common classification system hinders their ability to use for hydrological applications. In this study, a common classification system was developed for WaPOR and MD12Q1 data sets by using LANDSAT 8 satellite images. The classification scheme consisting of five land cover classes was then employed by logical sequence to extract land cover information of the Malwatu Oya River Basin. Among several indices tested, the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was selected as a suitable index for identifying water areas, which achieved an accuracy of $ 85\%$. Additionally, a combination of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the slope found water areas with an acceptable accuracy of over $ 75\%$. The $NDVI$ proved to be the most effective index for capturing forest areas and cropland, with an accuracy exceeding $ 80\%$. Furthermore, the $NDVI$ difference method was adopted to identify cropland areas. The Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) was identified as a moderately suitable index for delineating built-up areas. The developed land cover map provided a datum for assessing temporal changes in watershed LC and the proposed methodology can be used for integrating remote sensing technology for water resource management in other river basins.","2691-364X","979-8-3503-4521-6","10.1109/MERCon60487.2023.10355517","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10355517","Reclassification;NDVI;Landsat 8;WaPOR;MCD12Q1","Sequential analysis;Urban areas;Forestry;Watersheds;Landsat;Feature extraction;Satellite images","","","","18","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study proposes an algorithmic method for selecting resistor values in Marx generators to generate lightning impulse test waveforms. The proposed method establishes a circuit model based on the transformer’s frequency response and uses an optimization algorithm that combines a genetic algorithm with simulations of electromagnetic transients. The primary objective of the optimization process is to minimize the difference between the desired and simulated waveforms while obtaining optimum resistor block values. The proposed optimization-enabled method not only enhances accuracy in testing procedures but also reduces testing time and improves protection for test transformers.

Similarly, in dentistry, these could lead to missed diagnoses, wrong or unnecessary therapies, loss of patient trust, and even life-threatening complications. Therefore, it is important to enhance the cognitive and kinetic skills of healthcare professionals to minimize or avoid errors that could happen during patient management. However, in traditional in-class clinical settings, achieving optimum training could be limited due to the unavailability of an adequate number of clinical supervisors, fewer resources, lack of opportunities for detailed attention; constructive feedback and playback systems. In contrast, Virtual patient simulators, which are computerbased software programs provide a simulated environment where health professionals can practice, learn, and study various clinical scenarios and procedures repeatedly until the required skills are gained. Yet, such systems may lack realism and are not tailormade to support educational approaches such as problem-based learning with increased guided practice at a relatively low cost. Hence, this work proposes a web-based virtual patient simulator as a supportive tool to further help students to grow and advance the required diagnostic skills in a virtual environment. The system enables students to gather the patient’s medical history, conduct physical examinations, request and analyze laboratory and imaging tests and ultimately make informed diagnostic and treatment decisions.

Inadequate disposal methods for bottom ash pose health and environmental risks. The study examines bottom ash characteristics and assesses resulting cement block properties following established standards. Solid cement blocks measuring 300mm I 100mm I 150mm were produced using a mixture comprising 1:6:3 cement: fine aggregate: quarry chips volume ratio with a constant water/cement ratio of 0.8. Using conventional table vibratory compaction, blocks are fabricated with varying proportions of bottom ash ranging from 0% to 60% by volume in increments of 10%. After 7,28, and 56 days, the compressive strength and water absorption of the cement blocks are tested. The findings indicate that increasing the proportion of bottom ash reduces the density, compressive strength, durability, and specific heat capacity of the blocks while increasing water absorption. Based on the limited analysis, replacing op to 5056 of the fine aggregate with sieved waste-to-energy plant bottom ash is feasible in conventional cement block production for load-bearing walls in residential buildings up to four stories, using the mix proportions examined in this study.","2691-364X","979-8-3503-4521-6","10.1109/MERCon60487.2023.10355445","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10355445","bottom ash;cement block;strength;water absorption;load-bearing walls","Waste management;Waste materials;Absorption;Aggregates;Volume measurement;Buildings;Water heating","","","","14","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The annual exceedance probability of each event is considered separately to match the project design return period, without considering the joint probability of events. Though this approach is conservative, it always overestimates the flood risk and therefore leads to overdesign. This study aims to develop a design and operation procedure to optimize the pumping by incorporating the possibilities of phase differences of high rainfall events, high flood events, and high water levels at sea.The Kalu Oya-Mudun Ela sub-watershed at the downstream reach of the Kelani River is selected for the analysis. The probability of occurrence of a rainfall event above the 25-year return period and 10-year return period in Colombo gauging station, while Kelani River is at a minor flood level of 1.5 m MSL at Nagalagam Street is found to be 1.4#x0025; and 2.2#x0025;. The probability of occurrence of storm surge events and rainfall events at the Colombo gauging station is 100#x0025; and the occurrence of storm surge and rainfall while downstream reach is above minor flood level is 4#x0025;. It is shown that the gravity drainage of the local catchment is possible until the flood level of Nagalagam Street reaches 1.5 m MSL.

The non-linear finite element code LS-DYNA was used to develop a two-dimensional axisymmetric numerical model and its output was compared with previously published experimental results obtained from a single-stage gas gun test that are in good agreement. An analytical model was developed using MATLAB that tracks and solves the interaction of each propagation wave in the flyer-target system. The associated Reimann problem for each interaction is identified and solved. The analytical model was validated by comparing its stress-time histories with the outputs obtained by the already validated numerical model and here too, the outcomes agreed well with one another.

Out of the two technologies used for thermoacoustic energy conversion, use of traveling waves was found to be more efficient than using standing waves. However still, the correlations between energy conversion efficiency and the design parameters need to be established by simulation as well as experiments. Here, a single stage traveling wave thermoacoustic generator was considered using an existing computational model. The influence of the ambient temperature and the length of the regenerator on the energy conversion efficiency was investigated. According to the results, the efficiency of the device increases with increasing ambient temperature for a constant regenerator length, while for a given ambient temperature the efficiency increased with the increasing regenerator length.

Virtual synchronous inertia is used to increase the inertia of inverter-based microgrids to provide the same performance as synchronous generators. Frequency stability and power sharing among the distributed energy resources of islanded microgrids would be challenging due to poor transient response with droop controllers and inaccurate selection of droop values. This article proposes an adaptive droop controller for a microgrid in islanded operation that has several distributed energy resources including solar PV, diesel generator, and energy storage. Droop values, and reference values in the droop characteristics curve are decided based on the severity of the frequency disturbance and the state of charge level of the energy storage. The performance of the proposed droop controller is verified using a radial-connected microgrid derived based on a real distribution system.

The findings were obtained through computational modeling of aerosol diffusion within fibrous filters. The identified optimal region demonstrates that achieving nearly maximum filtration efficiency does not require indiscriminately increasing the sticking coefficient; surpassing a marginal value of 0.5 is sufficient.

Recently, the number of crop damages due to animal interventions has increased. As a solution to this problem, an animal recognition and repel system is proposed. The proposed system detects the animal’s presence, identifies the animal, and diverts the identified animal away from the agriculture field. A passive infrared (PIR) sensor detects the presence of any animal in the surrounding area and, the sound analysis system identifies the animal by analyzing the sound of the site. Further, the identified animal will be driven away by generating specific ultrasonic sounds that can only irritate the particular animal with a combination of a bright light-emitting diode (LED) that works only in a dark environment. Moreover, a message is transmitted to the owner by notifying the type of animal through a Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) module. Therefore, the notified owner can work on additional protection methods. This paper presents the development and testing of the system, including its effectiveness in various environments and its ability to repel different types of animals.

Prior to the tensile tests, all samples underwent normalization heat treatment. The experimental results demonstrate a progressive decrease in yield stress accompanied by an improvement in ductility as the pulse frequency increases, up to a frequency of 0.83 Hz. These findings suggest a positive influence of the electroplasticity effect on the tensile properties of plain carbon steels. However, beyond 0.83 Hz, despite further reduction in yield stress, a gradual decline in ductility is observed until a frequency of 1.64 Hz, primarily attributed to enhanced strain localization and induced defects resulting in premature fracture. Microstructural analysis reveals that the fracture surfaces of samples tested under electrical current exhibit intermediate grain sizes between non-deformed samples and deformed samples tested without current. Additionally, the presence of characteristic dimples on the fractographs further supports the observed variation in ductility with pulse frequency.

Optimizing hydropower generation and scheduling can lead to significant profits for both the power company and the country. Optimization of hydropower generation is a nonlinear problem. The nonlinearity occurs due to the generating characteristic of the machines, whose outputs are generally a nonlinear function of water discharge and net hydraulic head. This paper presents a strategy for the optimum distribution of dispatched power among its available generating units by taking into account both the nonlinear characteristic and the head loss effect. The objective is the maximization of the total power generation for a low-head hydropower plant under varying head and for a given total water discharge rate.

This research focused on Flood Frequency Analysis (FFA) in the Ratnapura region of Sri Lanka to estimate the return period of floods, which is crucial for flood management and infrastructure planning. Annual Peak Discharge (APD) data from the Ratnapura station over 44 years were fitted to five probability distributions: Generalized Extreme Value (GEV), Gumbel (GUM), Pearson Type 3 (PT3), Log Normal 3 (LN3), and Generalized Logistic (GLO). Stationarity was assessed using the Mann-Kendall and Levene's tests, indicating no trends in the series. Serial independence was analyzed using Turning Point and Anderson's autocorrelation tests, confirming randomness. L-moments, a parameter estimation method, were utilized, and the GEV distribution was the best fit from the Lmoment ratio diagram. The study estimated a major flood occurrence in Ratnapura approximately once every three years. However, accurate FFA is vital to minimize economic and social impact due to floods and to design resilient infrastructure. Further, this study shows that the GEV distribution is a potential model for regional FFA of Sri Lankan rivers.","2691-364X","979-8-3503-4521-6","10.1109/MERCon60487.2023.10355531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10355531","FFA;L-moment method;Probability Distributions;Ratnapura;Return Period;Upper Kalu River Basin","Time-frequency analysis;Time series analysis;Turning;Market research;Probability distribution;Discharges (electric);Rivers","","1","","24","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to accurately establish whether the reflection signatures produced from sub-bottom profiling match the fresh or weathered rock layer in the bedrock, an accurate interpretation of the signatures is necessary. This study employed a boomer profiler as the seismic sound source with a frequency of 1kHz to survey the west side of Colombo Port in Sri Lanka. Sub-bottom profiling data were interpreted using the SonarWiz software based on the principle of the trends of the reflected signal. The interpretation mainly focused on identifying the bedrock layer from the sub-bottom profile data and it includes 8 survey lines. 12 Borehole data was used to validate the interpreted results, along with the Standard Penetration Test (SPT) values.

The log transformation is used to stabilize the variation of data in each variable. The Johansen co-integration test results confirmed that the Consumer Price Index, Producer Price Index, Imports and Broad Money Supply have a significant long run equilibrium relationship. In the long run, the Producer Price Index and the Broad Money Supply both have a positive effect on the Colombo Consumer Price Index, while Imports have a negative effect. The Vector Error Correction (VEC) model’s short run estimation results show that the Producer Price Index, Imports and Broad Money Supply are weakly exogenous to the Consumer Price Index. The Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), Schwarz Criteria (SC) and F-statistics indicated a fairly good fit of the VEC model. The diagnostic tests of the VEC model proved that the residual assumptions of no serial correlation, no heteroskedasticity and multivariate normally distributed are satisfied.

In reliability-based planning, these indices are computed using reliability planning models. Such models require failure rates and mean downtimes of distribution feeders as inputs. At present, there is a lack of models for calculating operational mean downtimes of distribution feeders. This paper proposes a Markov model which represents failures in a feeder and operations circumstances in fault recovery. This proposed model can efficiently calculate the operational mean downtime of a feeder, using analytical equations. An algorithm and a graphical user interface are also developed based on the proposed model, in order to integrate the proposed model with software tools. Two case studies are conducted on two selected feeders, using actual data obtained from failure and repair histories and experts' opinion. Results of case studies show the applicability of our proposed Markov model-based algorithm to calculate mean downtimes of distribution feeders. The Markov model is validated by comparing results provided by the proposed algorithm with the results obtained using Monte Carlo simulation.

In this research, a system that can be used to predict the FoG in Parkinson’s patients well ahead of the event was developed. This is a multimodal sensor system that consists of Plantar pressure sensors placed in the insole of the shoes and Inertial Measurement Units placed on the shank of each leg. 3 machine learning algorithms were developed: K means, K Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines. Out of the 3 algorithms used, the KNN algorithm was determined to have the highest FoG prediction sensitivity of 0.88. The Pressure sensors captured more swift variations in Gait during freezing compared to the IMUs. This system could identify FoG 4.42s ahead of the event and used an optimal time window of 1s.

Some studies indicate that the elastic modulus ($E_{50}$) of soil can be increased by several times to obtain the unloading-reloading modulus ($E_{ur}$) of the soil. The back analysis technique was used to calibrate the elastic modulus of the soil by comparing the lateral wall deformation profile obtained from the FEM analysis with the inclinometer readings acquired from the excavation site. The numerical model was validated using the behavior of a retaining wall at various excavation depths and analyzed through numerical simulations. Prop forces obtained from the numerical analysis were compared with those obtained from different empirical methods commonly used to estimate prop forces on multi-propped retaining structures.

Therefore, this research focuses to identify potential methods in reusing tertile waste as a readily available, light-weight, cost-effective and non-load bearing partitioning wall material which can apply for building interiors. In the experimental design, discarded fabrics and four varieties of adhesives were used namely, epory-resin, polyvinyl acetate (PVA), multi-bond (general purpose solvent-based rubber adhesive), and natural cashew glue to produce a wastefabric-wall-board (WFWB). The fabric layers were glued with selected adhesives and manually compressed in timber moulds to make 10 mm thick partition boards. Tensile test was carried out complying with ASTM D3039 and acoustic test were carried out according to the ASTM C423. The natural cashew glue samples have given the highest teusile value and recorded the $9.0\mathrm{~N}/\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ of ultimate tensile stress (UTS).

The synthesis was simple and was carried out at $4 ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ without mechanical or magnetic agitation. The volume ratio for aniline to hydrogen peroxide was 3:1. It is proposed that the reaction proceed through radical polymerization, in which hydroxyl radicals (OH•) are generated by the action of hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2) to polymerize aniline. The formation of HCl-doped Polyaniline (PANI) was confirmed using of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. The purification process is easier, and the risk of harmful byproducts is reduced as the reaction continues under benign conditions. Additional benefits of using H2 O2 as an oxidizing agent include higher polymer purity, increased scalability, and improved control over polymerization kinetics. Overall, this novel synthetic approach using 50:50 (water/hydrogen peroxide) as an oxidizing agent for PANI offers a promising avenue for efficient, sustainable, facile, and catalyst-free production of HCl-doped PANI, with potential uses in a plethora of areas, including electronics, energy, and sensing of volatile gases at relatively low concentrations.

The road prioritisation process is defined using the Prioritisation Index (PI), which considers factors such as population density, average daily traffic (ADT), and the availability of alternative roads. Optimisation analysis incorporates cost estimation and damage condition-related indices such as the International Roughness Index (IRI) and the Damage Index (DI). The model aims to minimise damage recovery costs within the constraints of the available budget by modifying key parameters, including the reduction factor and percentage values of recovery. The applicability of the developed model has been demonstrated through an illustrative example involving a provincial road network. This methodology presents a streamlined approach to integrating disaster resilience into provincial road pavement management systems (PMS).","2691-364X","979-8-3503-4521-6","10.1109/MERCon60487.2023.10355511","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10355511","Optimization;Resilience;Budget allocation;Prioritisation","Costs;Systematics;Roads;Urban areas;Rough surfaces;Planning;Indexes","","","","17","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hydrological observations in various kinds are essential for constraining a reliable set of parameters for hydrological simulations. Soil moisture, which is listed among the fifty essential climate variables by the Global Climate Observing System, plays a crucial role in this process. Due to practical issues, when estimating the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture in basin-scale hydrological modelling, RSSM products are a viable solution over in-situ measurements. In this study, the ABCD hydrological model was used to simulate soil moisture in different seasons of the watershed. Finally, the RSSM data from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP L4) satellite were integrated with the soil moisture estimations from the hydrological model to recalibrate the parameters. The findings of this study suggest that the integration of SMAP L4 to the ABCD model has no significant impact in enhancing the accuracy.

The thermal properties derived from the Eurocode 5 and newly obtained properties are compared to assess their accuracy in capturing the post-fall-off behavior of CLT.

Results show consistent tip velocity across depths, with a slightly higher velocity of 14.2 mm/s at approximately 330 mm depth. The tip velocity increases with the flow rate but at a decreasing rate. The average tip force per unit length decreases with greater depth, exhibiting a nearly linear distribution from 533 mm to around 203 mm.

It involves replacing weak and unstable soil types like peat, medium or soft clay, and organic soils with more reliable and competent materials such as crushed concrete, granular soil, or rock boulders. By implementing soil replacement, the bearing capacity of the foundation is increased, while the expected settlement is reduced. This leads to improved overall stability and performance of the foundation system. This paper presents the results of the study on partial soft soil replacement under shallow foundations. The effects on the width and depth of the replacement, soft soil properties, and properties of the replacement materials have been studied. A two-dimensional plain strain model is developed using the finite element program, PLAXIS 2D. To ensure its accuracy and reliability, the model is initially validated by comparing its results with a case available in the literature. The results obtained from the analysis indicate that as the width and depth of the replacement increase, the settlement decreases. Based on the results, it is recommended to utilize a replacement width of 1.25 times the width of the footing and a replacement depth of 2 times the width of the footing. As replacement materials, granular soil and rock boulders can be recommended.","2691-364X","979-8-3503-4521-6","10.1109/MERCon60487.2023.10355458","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10355458","Partial Replacement;Shallow Foundations;Ground Improvement;Settlement;Numerical Modelling;PLAXIS 2D","Two dimensional displays;Soil properties;Materials reliability;Soil;Rocks;Stability analysis;Numerical models","","","","9","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is a mechanism to adjust the gripper arms which can be performed inside a higher reconfigurable working area. This gripper can grip less thick and delicate foods compared to conventional grippers while maintaining a higher grasping success rate. A prototype of the gripper was evaluated in an experimental setup, where real ingredients were used. The gripper demonstrated versatile grasping capabilities, allowing for a wide range of foods to be handled effectively. A maximum bending angle of the gripper 41° was obtained without load for the applied pressure values. The gripper exhibited a maximum pulling force of 18.2 N at a 40 kPa (abs) pressure.

A digital elevation model (DEM) with reasonable accuracy should be used in the initial stage of hydrologic applications. There are different sources and platforms which offer different resolution DEMs with different accuracy levels. Several parameters decide the DEM quality. Identification of each of these parameters with defined accuracy levels which represent their suitability for distinct studies is crucial for developing applications and mitigation measures. This study focuses on addressing the requirement of a tailormade methodology to assess DEM accuracy levels in tandem with associated applications to ensure their optimum performance. For this study, open source SRTM and ASTER DEMs, TOPO maps of $1:50,000,1:10,000$ resolutions, and LiDAR data were used focusing on the upstream $50\mathrm{~km}^{2}$ subcatchment in Kelani River Basin in Sri Lanka. Accuracy assessments were completed under two different approaches by comparison and correlation of spot elevation points and profiles examined for different geographic directions. As a conclusion for the profile-based observation, it was identified that the accuracy levels are high in the DEMs produced based on the high-resolution LiDAR and satellite images in the study area.

The presence of high levels of Non-Revenue Water (NRW) further exacerbates these challenges, coupled with limited availability of funds. NRW poses a barrier to sustainability due to energy and water losses. Therefore, this research aims to focus specifically on addressing the issue of NRW to contribute to sustainable water management. The research objectives include exploring water losses in the transmission and distribution systems, primarily attributable to leakages, and evaluating the performance of individual water pipes. To accomplish the objectives, the study employs the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to assess various factors contributing to pipe leakages. The AHP methodology enables the identification and prioritization of key factors influencing pipe leakages, providing valuable insights for enhancing the performance and maintenance of water distribution systems. By identifying the factors contributing to pipeline leakage, proactive measures can be implemented to prevent and control leaks at an early stage, thereby shifting from a reactive to a proactive approach in water management. This transition will enable the industry to detect and address leakage issues more effectively, leading to improved overall water management and a reduction in NRW. The research focuses on the Gampaha Water Supply Scheme as a case study, aiming to develop effective strategies for reducing NRW. The findings of this research will provide practical recommendations for policymakers and water management authorities to optimize water supply systems, minimize losses, and enhance sustainability in urban water supply schemes.","2691-364X","979-8-3503-4521-6","10.1109/MERCon60487.2023.10355422","University of Moratuwa; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10355422","AHP analysis;Non-Revenue Water;Urban Water Distribution;Water Leakage","Resistance;Performance evaluation;Industries;Pipelines;Water conservation;Maintenance engineering;Propagation losses","","","","14","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This happens due to the fact that the 2-D masking filter requires spatial samples equal to the spatial order at the input. Therefore, the output of the 2-D spatially-interpolated prototype filter should be computed for more than one spatial index. In order to address this limitation, we propose a 2-D spatially-interpolated FIR filter using a parallel structure. With the proposed structure, both 2-D spatially-interpolated prototype filter and the 2-D masking filter need to compute the output only for one spatial index, therefore allowing to employ sparse linear arrays. In order to support broadband beamforming, we design the 2-D FIR filter to have a parallelogram passband. Furthermore, we design the 2-D FIR filter to have linear phase response and to be optimal in the minimax sense. The simulation results confirm that the proposed 2-D FIR filter provides a considerable reduction in the number of antennas, compared to previously proposed 2-D FIR filters, with a slight degradation in the fidelity of enhanced broadband signals, which are distorted by strong radio frequency interference and noise signals.","2691-364X","979-8-3503-4521-6","10.1109/MERCon60487.2023.10355500","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10355500","2-D FIR filters;sparse linear arrays;broadband beamforming;parallel structure;minimax design.","Maximum likelihood detection;Fans;Finite impulse response filters;Simulation;Prototypes;Nonlinear filters;Broadband communication","","1","","32","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It allows for the evaluation of the garment’s ability to absorb impact and reduce the risk of injuries during high-impact sports activities. Measuring shock absorbency ensures the bra offers compression, encapsulation, and structural support, preventing excessive breast movement and potential injuries. It also helps to make predictions for the sports garment production process and helps to minimize the pain of the athletes during sports activities. The test method involves using a motion capture camera system to analyze the breast displacement level during physical activity, with the sports bra worn by a physical model. Here in this study sensor system is used to gather the displacement, velocity and acceleration data of certain points and created a new artificial model to measure the absorbency level of sports garments and to collect data during physical activities.Analysing breast displacement data creates a mathematical model that predicts material and design before sample preparation.

Garcinia morella is a tropical plant commonly found in regions of Asia, especially in Sri Lanka and it is also called Gokatu or Gamboge. The tree exudes a yellowish resin, used as a color in $18^{\text{th}}$-century temple paintings in Sri Lanka. Despite its historical use in art, there is no prior evidence of its application to cotton textiles. This pioneering research assesses the fluid’s dyeing potential and suitability for cotton, evaluates its colorfastness, and fills a significant void in the research gap. An aqueous extraction method was used to separate Garcinia morella fluid from coloring agents. The dye’s properties were analyzed using pH, FTIR and UV-vis methods. Pre-and post-mordanting techniques were employed with three natural mordants: Terminalia chebula powder, Ferrous sulfate $(\mathrm{FeSO}_{4}\cdot\mathbf{7 H}_{2}\mathrm{O})$ and Alum $(\mathrm{KAl}(\mathrm{SO}_{4})_{2}\cdot 12\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O})$. Evaluation of the dyed samples showed better outcomes with pre-mordanting in terms of colorfastness, $K/S$, and $CIE~Lab$ values. The dye rendered cotton textile in shades ranging from yellow to brown. In conclusion, Garcinia morella proves to be a promising dye source for cotton textiles. This discovery revitalizes an ancient Sri Lankan pigment, pointing towards eco-friendly dyeing alternatives for a sustainable future.","2691-364X","979-8-3503-4521-6","10.1109/MERCon60487.2023.10355389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10355389","Garcinia morella;yellow;natural dye;cotton fabric;dyeing;color fastness","Fluids;Powders;Temperature;Color;Vegetation;Pigments;Fabrics","","","","23","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, this study analyzed the performance of predicting the pressure transmission percentage of soft pneumatic actuators via an artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple linear regression models (MLR) in establishing optimum design parameters. It was observed that the lowest MSE on training data was recorded from MLR, however, better performances were recorded for the ANN model on testing data.

Out of them, Neighborhood EVs (NEVs) are more attractive for shortdistance traveling for day-to-day work. One of the major issues with NEVs is range anxiety. Advancements in battery technology have increased the driving range of NEVs recently. In addition, rooftop-mounted Photovoltaic (PV) systems on NEVs are being evaluated as a possible solution for range anxiety by facilitating frequent replenishment of the battery charge. The conventional PV system is designed for static applications. Hence, due to rapid variations of irradiance that a NEV can experience when moving, the output power of the integrated PV system would be lesser leading to a low efficient system. This has to be addressed by utilizing an efficiencyimproved controller. This paper proposed the methodology of developing an efficiency-improved controller for NEV with a rooftop PV system by analyzing the irradiance pattern experienced. This is achieved by evaluating the optimum controller parameters. In the proposed methodology, three approaches have been presented static controller, dynamic controller by forecasting the next irradiance variation, and dynamic controller with variable step generator. The most optimum approach can be selected based on the application of NEV. Further, the designing of a PV system for an Electric Three-Wheeler utilizing the proposed methodology has been carried out and the performance of the proposed system has been confirmed and verified by simulating in PSCAD simulation software.","2691-364X","979-8-3503-4521-6","10.1109/MERCon60487.2023.10355486","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10355486","Coupling PV System with EV;PV Dynamic Controller;Enhanced MPPT Algorithm;PV System PSCAD Simulation","Couplings;Photovoltaic systems;Heuristic algorithms;Power system dynamics;Anxiety disorders;Solar energy;Software","","","","10","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
