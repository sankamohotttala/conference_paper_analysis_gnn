The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Future communication links will require higher data rates, multiple beams, and higher transmit/receive gains, in addition to smaller weight, cost, and power. With the growing interest for reduced size platforms and the requirement for ultra-wideband (UWB) performance to address multi-functionality, there is a strong need for UWB RF front ends with ultra-flexible interfaces. The latter will include millimeter wave and THz capabilities to enable increased spectral efficiency, multi-functionality and security. Simultaneous transmit and receive (STAR) transceivers are also becoming a focus for the coming decade. Further, in recent years, a variety of flexible fabric-based electronics have been proposed. To this end, our team proposed a new class of conductive textiles that have demonstrated unique capabilities in terms of flexibility, durability and manufacturing-ease using standard automated embroidery machinery. These electronic threads (E-threads) have the capability to generate fully embroidered microwave circuitry that has the same electrical properties as traditional microwave circuits printed on PCBs. As such, a new class of wearable devices that are fully integrated and inconspicuously placed within clothing is possible. This presentation will focus on innovative methods for handling UWB communications with RF front end and back-end capabilities having historically low power and game-changing frequency-independent operation. They will include low power MIMO and beamforming across large bandwidths, from MHz to millimeter wave bands. Challenges in realizing future textile-based electronic devices, including wearable wideband transceivers will be presented. Among them, reliable wearable interconnects, chipsets that are less bulky and integrated with the textile circuitry, and manufacturing challenges will be discussed.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-3753-0","10.1109/MERCon52712.2021.9525697","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9525697","","Wearable computers;Transceivers;Textiles;Radio frequency;Millimeter wave communication;Microwave devices;Microwave communication","","","","","IEEE","14 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The forthcoming revolution of transport engineering needs an interdisciplinary perspective between civil engineering, automatic control, vehicle engineering, and communications. In this seminar, a few recent studies will be presented to improve infrastructure performance through the consolidation of these systems. We use two applications to illustrate the future integration: Optimal Eco-driving Control of Autonomous and Electric Trucks in Adaptation to Highway Topography and optimal trajectory design for vehicle sorting to facilitate emergency vehicles in freeway configurations. For the former application, we embed the trajectory optimization in a model predictive control framework in order to regulate the real time speeds of trucks for energy optimization and battery life extension. For the latter application, we propose a cooperative control strategy to provide local Emergency vehicles (EVs) preemption at highway configurations. The basic idea is to clear the lane to be used by EV through cooperative driving with surrounding connected and automated vehicle platoons. We also predict the way forward for future transport systems.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-3753-0","10.1109/MERCon52712.2021.9525687","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9525687","","Road transportation;Civil engineering;Trajectory optimization;Traffic control;Systems architecture;Surfaces;Sorting","","","","","IEEE","14 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nanomaterials provide numerous advantages over conventional materials such as improvements in quality and sustainability performance and reduction in cost and time for use. Sri Lanka is geographically rich with mineral resources that contain suitable raw materials for producing nanomaterials. Despite this, adoption of nanotechnology in the Sri Lankan construction industry is low. This paper therefore aims to investigate the availability and application of nanotechnology and nanomaterials in the Sri Lankan construction industry. Considering the novelty of the area, a qualitative research approach was adopted for this study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with experts in the field of nanotechnology to gather the required data and content analysis techniques were used to analyze the qualitative data collected. The study findings reveal that nanomaterials can be produced using locally available mineral resources. However, Sri Lanka is yet to realize the optimum value from its mineral resources that can be used in the production of nanomaterials. Further empirical opinions regarding the feasibility of producing nanomaterials in Sri Lanka are also offered through this research.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-3753-0","10.1109/MERCon52712.2021.9525756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9525756","nanotechnology;nanomaterials;construction","Costs;Production;Nanomaterials;Raw materials;Mineral resources;Sustainable development;Interviews","","","","44","IEEE","14 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, there is a need of correlating compaction characteristics with other physical properties of bottom ash which can be obtained easily. This paper describes an innovative solution to predict the compaction properties of coal bottom ash for the preliminary assessment prior to geotechnical engineering related field applications. The data for required parameters of bottom ash for the model development were collected through a literature survey representing different parts of the world. After stepwise regression analysis, specific gravity and uniformity coefficient were found to be the most significant input parameters to predict the compaction characteristics of bottom ash. These parameters were then used to develop the models to predict maximum dry density and optimum moisture content of bottom ash using multiple regression analysis. The developed models were accurate with a prediction accuracy less than ±3% for both maximum dry density and optimum moisture content models. These empirical models were also presented graphically. According to those predictive curves, maximum dry density increases with increasing uniformity coefficient and specific gravity while optimum moisture content reduced.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-3753-0","10.1109/MERCon52712.2021.9525782","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9525782","bottom ash;compaction characteristics;gradational parameters;multiple regression analysis;specific gravity","Analytical models;Moisture;Ash;Coal;Predictive models;Soil;Compaction","","","","34","IEEE","14 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, cellulose fibers were extracted from rice straw via a set of chemical processes. Then using high intensity ultrasonication (HIUS) treatment acquired cellulose fibers were individualized into nanofibrillated cellulose. Structural, morphological and thermal behavior of NFC throughout the chemo-mechanical processes were studied. FTIR analysis confirmed that the chemical composition of nanofibrillated cellulose was mainly cellulose where amorphous natured hemicellulose and lignin were effectively removed during chemical processes. From the set of chemical processes, Murunkan variety yielded around 34 per cent cellulose fibers. Out of these cellulose fibers around 17 per cent NFC was individualized via the HIUS treatment.

The present research work focuses on incorporation of rice straw ash as an alternative filler material in rubber compounding. Up to date, different ratios of rice straw ash has been incorporated with selected rubber compound replacing the silica filler loading and tensile, tear strength, hardness, compression set properties have been investigated. These properties were compared with those of the reference sample prepared according to the same formulation but without adding rice straw ash. The sample containing the same proportion of rice straw ash and silica showed the highest tensile strength compared with that of the control sample. Further, tensile strength of the sample which contained only rice straw ash was also higher than that of the control sample. The rice straw ash has a strong ability to improve the tensile properties of the rubber vulcanizates, while it negatively affects the other mechanical properties such as hardness, tear strength and compression set.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-3753-0","10.1109/MERCon52712.2021.9525799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9525799","plant-based waste;rice straw ash;silica;rubber compounding","Silicon compounds;Rubber products;Loading;Ash;Belts;Air pollution;Mechanical factors","","1","","26","IEEE","14 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In textile manufacturing, cotton is blended with various other synthetic fibers such as polyester, nylon and lycra to obtain the desired properties. Though fabric recycling methods are available for pre-consumer garment waste, the processes are quite complicated in actual practice. In this work Microcrystalline Cellulose (MCC) extracted from cotton fabric waste was converted into Microfibrillated Cellulose (MFC) using acid hydrolysis method. However, the major challenge in using acid hydrolysis method is the low amount of yield. Three experimental factors that includes; acid concentration, hydrolysis time and temperature show the highest effect in yield and quality of MFC. Therefore, this experiment was designed to optimize the effect of these three independent factors on yield (%) and width (nm) of MFC.

However, several aspects such as climatic conditions, land and fuel availability, DG location and DG size need to be carefully considered to harness the best results from integrating DG units for power networks. Among them, sizing of DG units has taken a prominent place as it affects the network operation as well as the cost aspect. Optimizing the sizes of prospective DG units that are intended to be integrated for a given network will facilitate in gaining the expected merits such as minimizing active power losses and voltage deviations without causing any stability, protection and power quality issue. The existing methodologies for determining optimal DG sizes are rather sophisticated. This paper presents a robust mathematical solving approach based on Lagrange Multiplier Method (LMM) for determining the optimal DG sizes for minimizing the active power losses and voltage deviations.

But they are unable to perform frequency regulation resulting in higher frequency deviations with higher integration of RESs. To overcome this problem power converters are modified as synchronous generators using proper control mechanisms called as Virtual Synchronous Generators (VSGs). Energy Storage Systems are required to absorb and deliver excess energy. We have used a battery/ultracapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS) to achieve this. Power allocation for the two storage units is modeled such that fast-varying power fluctuations are compensated by ultracapacitor (UC) and low frequency power fluctuations are compensated by the battery. This is achieved by emulating the inertia by the ultracapacitor and emulating reheat turbine model, droop control etc. by the battery. Some research produces the modelling details of HESS but not the sizing considering required performance. To fulfil this research gap sizing of the HESS is presented through this research paper. Eventually, the proposed system was implemented and simulated in MATLAB Simulink.

This can be accomplished by precisely adjusting the valve opening of the primary supply to heat exchangers. PID controllers are being commonly used as the conventional control method while many other control strategies are offering better performance and hence allowing significant energy saving.

Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the effect of size and the relative positioning of plies of an RUC of two-ply plain weave carbon fibre laminate on mechanical property predictions. First, a series of meso-mechanical models with different relative positionings of plies and sizes of RUCs were modelled. Then the constitutive relationship was developed for each RUC model. Finally, the calculated mechanical properties are compared with the experimental results to investigate the influence of size and relative positioning on the predictions. The results indicate that the effect of both the size and relative positioning of the RUC is minimal except for a few parameters.

The underlying mechanics in the deployment of creased membrane structures are self-opening and then forced-opening beyond a stable stress-free state. The focus of the previous studies was limited to the characterisation of crease behaviour during force opening. This paper presents an experimental study to characterise the crease mechanics of a single creased membrane during self-opening behaviour which is crucial in the design of gossamer structures. A simple analytical study was performed to predict the moment-rotation response of the crease and hence shows a good qualitative agreement with physical experiment results.

Despite advances in numerical models for the prediction of ground-borne vibration, it is yet unclear how effective deep piled foundations are at mitigating the vibration transmitted into a building compared to shallow foundations, such as footings. The power-flow insertion gain is used as a measure of the building's overall vibration performance when piles, rather than footings, are included in the foundation.

This research deals with the crack width analysis of circular RC columns in straight viaduct sections. A comprehensive study was carried out regarding the behaviour of the cracks in circular RC columns in viaduct sections as per the design standard, BS 5400. Autodesk Structural Bridge Design software was used to perform crack width calculations and MIDAS Civil software was used to do the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and validation process. The comprehensive design charts developed in this research will be useful in calculating the crack widths in circular RC columns without following any time-consuming methods.

The use of bamboo as an alternative to steel reinforcement will reduce the energy consumption in construction and reduce the cost. To investigate the feasibility of using bamboo as an alternative reinforcement, the bamboo fiber mix concrete, and bamboo reinforcement in a structural element such as beam were tested under compressive and flexural tests. The experimental study consisted of 12 cubes and 6 beams specimens. Results show that the load-carrying capacity of concrete beams reduced because of the usage of bamboo fiber in concrete. However, the ultimate load-carrying capacity in a hybrid beam was observed to almost equal to the steel-reinforced beam and showed a similar deflection.

Initially, a series of chemical treatment methods that includes removal of wax and oil, lignin, hemicellulose and silica was employed to extract cellulose fibers from the aforementioned rice straw varieties. Then, using high-intensity ultrasonication (HIUS) process microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) was isolated from the obtained chemically extracted cellulose fibers. FTIR analysis validated that the chemical composition of MFC from both varieties were mainly cellulose where hemicelluloses and lignin were successfully removed during the set of chemical processes. Study revealed that around 34 per cent cellulose was extracted from Pachaperumal and around 25 per cent cellulose was extracted from BG352. Out of these chemically extracted cellulose fibers around 16 per cent of MFC was disintegrated from Pachaperumal and around 9 per cent from BG352 via HIUS process.

Over the years, it has hardly seen any progress as an industry compared to other contemporary agriculture-based industries due to the inherent product-specific reasons as well as the long-practised custom of producing quills as the output form. Further, the attraction of the young generation towards this industry is minimal due to the low quality of work-life and poor regard it has, as a profession. Thus, the aim of this paper is to introduce a mechanised solution to improve the cinnamon peeling process by reducing the requirement of skill for peeling. Initially, an analysis was conducted on peeling methods and mechanisation efforts using information collected from published literature and through site visits to cinnamon processing centres. Then, a novel mechanism was proposed to improve the cinnamon peeling operation. Finally, a prototype was constructed and tested. The proposed solution shows promising results for cinnamon peeling for output forms other than quills. It is expected that both the traditional and value-added cinnamon product processing sector would benefit from the proposed solution.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-3753-0","10.1109/MERCon52712.2021.9525650","University of Moratuwa; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9525650","cinnamon peeling;mechanised cinnamon processing;single-stroke 360°-arc length peeling;quill making","Industries;Prototypes;Pharmaceuticals","","1","","15","IEEE","14 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SLW contained influent COD/SO4−2 ratio of 2.7, whereas the influent COD/TKN (Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen) ratio was 10.1. Complete sulfate reduction was observed in all phases under anaerobic condition. However, the least average rate of sulfate reduction and overall percentage sulfate reduction was observed for the 100.0 l/m3.d. During this phase, anaerobic reactor showed symptoms of overloading, unstable and most affected with shock load. In VL03, time taken for complete sulfate reduction increased by 77.5% as a result of the high rate of ammonia formation. For SLW, sulfate degradation reduces at higher volumetric loading, but for moderate volumetric loading sulfate reduction was efficient, and ammonia inhibition could not be observed.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-3753-0","10.1109/MERCon52712.2021.9525703","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9525703","Sulfate reduction;Ammonia inhibition;Anaerobic digestion","Proteins;Industries;Ammonia;Toxicology;Electric shock;Loading;Wastewater","","","","10","IEEE","14 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, this research aimed to quantify the global warming potential due to English brick manufacturing using cradle to gate Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. The functional unit used was one-meter square of the brick wall area. Data collection, analysis and interpretation of results were done by the ISO 14044/14040 standards. Primary life cycle inventory data was gathered via brick kiln owners and workers. The LCA assembly was modelled using the ‘OpenLCA’ software. Three product systems were defined according to the brick bond types and wall thicknesses. The global warming potential related to brick production was assessed using the ‘GWP 100a’ method. Clay excavation, clay transportation and wood chamber firing emerged as emission hotspots. The study revealed that the global warming potential of 225mm brick wall and 115mm brick wall as 11.9 and 5.9 kg CO2-eq/m2, respectively.

WSN makes monitoring of structures easy and fast with low-cost involved. However, some structures such as high-rise buildings, are considered difficult for establishing WSN due to the presence of vertical obstructions. Radio waves with low-frequency are widely used in long-range SHM applications and monitoring high-rise buildings. Carrier waves with lower frequencies used in WSN travel over long-range and through obstructions easily compared to waves that are with higher frequency. Even though the range is increased in low-frequency waves, data rate is also reduced with decreasing frequency.

This gas flow will drop the temperature of the reactor chamber and change the rate of convection heat loss by forced convection. Changing the rate of heat loss will change the model parameters. In the study four control structures were simulated and compared the performances. The simulation shows that the cascade controller successfully rejects the disturbance of the drop of chamber temperature, but it is not successful in rejection of the disturbance by change of convection heat loss rate of the reactor chamber.

It was also observed that the total lipid content of cultures did not vary significantly with light intensity. Moreover, it was observed that total lipid content of residual H. pluvialis decreased significantly after astaxanthin extraction.

Different technologies are used for drying coconut chips and hot air drying is the most popular method. Microwave (MW) drying has gained attention in many process industries due to its faceted benefits. This study examines the critical parameters governing the microwave drying of coconut chips. Sliced coconut chips of $1 \text{cm}\times 1\text{cm}\times 1\text{cm}$ were used. The effect of the two independent variables MW Power (100 W, 180 W, 300 W) and Mass Loading rate (20 g, 40 g, 60 g, 80 g, 100 g) on three response variables, moisture content, drying time and drying rate was examined. Air velocity of 0.6 m/s was circulated in the drying chamber to ensure convective mass transfer. The ratio of Microwave Power to the Mass Loading was found to define two distinct regions for selecting the mass loading for a given microwave power. At high MW power to mass loadings, the total drying time was found to be constant against the mass loading while at low MW power to mass loadings, the total drying time was found to increase with the mass loading for a given MW power. Considering both statistical conformity ($R^{2} > 0.995$, SSE and RMSE close to zero) and the simplicity together, Page model was identified as the best thin layer drying model for describing the Microwave Assisted Air Drying of coconut chips.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-3753-0","10.1109/MERCon52712.2021.9525801","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9525801","Coconut chips drying;Microwave drying;modeling the drying behavior;Effective moisture diffusivity","Industries;Microwave technology;Shape;Atmospheric modeling;Oils;Loading;Moisture","","1","","26","IEEE","14 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Central composite design of experiments (DOE) was applied to develop a statistical model to identify the main effects and interaction effects of process parameters: acid concentration, reaction temperature, and reaction time. The proposed quadratic model showed a high adjusted determination coefficient (0.91) and Fischer's test value (22.4), indicating that the model is adequate to characterize the relationships among the process parameters and explain the variation observed in response. Acid concentration and reaction temperature have significant first order and quadratic effects on hemicellulose recovery.

The effect of accelerator type on cure, crosslink density, physico-mechanical and dynamic-mechanical properties of efficient sulfur vulcanized natural rubber (NR) compounds was investigated. Results reveal that accelerator type does not only affect the cure characteristics, but also has a great impact on physical and mechanical properties, DIXP possess the least modulus and strength properties while providing satisfactory optimum cure time for the vulcanization compared to the TBBS accelerator. Improvement in mechanical properties is observed in the order ZBeC, TBzTD, TBBS and corroborates well with the crosslink density.

Bottom ash from the coal-fired boiler in Sri Lanka was used to replace manufactured sand at different percentages by volume of sand. Mechanical and durability properties of cement blocks were determined at the ages of 14, 28, and 56 days. Finally, developed statistical models to predict compressive strength, water absorption, and density of cement blocks. The results showed that the density and compressive strength of cement blocks decreased, and water absorption increased with an increasing replacement level of bottom ash. From the analysis, it can be concluded that up to 45 per cent of fine aggregate in the cement blocks can be replaced with sieved coal bottom ash to produce cement blocks, which satisfy the requirements of current SLS standards.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-3753-0","10.1109/MERCon52712.2021.9525739","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9525739","coal bottom ash;cement mixtures;cement blocks;coal-fired boiler;statistical models","Absorption;Aggregates;Ash;Coal;Predictive models;Boilers;Solids","","","","22","IEEE","14 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CEB spends reasonable amount on transmission line construction. However, this cost could be reduced by optimizing the towers. To optimize the towers, need optimized design inputs with an optimum tower configuration. This study intends to identify the economic viability of the CEB design inputs against IS802:1:1 and IEC60826 inputs. The objective of the research was achieved by identifying different design inputs and analyzing two towers (one TDL, one TD3) in PLS tower software. The design was completed with ASCE10-97.

Therefore, there is increasing interest in finding alternative materials for river sand. Manufactured sand is one of the alternatives as it has some advantages over river sand. It provides a better contribution to the strength of the cementitious material, better workability, lesser cement consumption, and eco-friendly. The present study is focused on the progress of a sustainable masonry binding mortar by experimental investigations with manufactured sand as a replacement for river sand.

In this regard, the present work is focused on assessing the REE potential in the beach placers along the southwest coastline in Sri Lanka. The collected 36 beach sand samples from the mean sea-level in the southwest coast during both southwestern and northeastern monsoons were subjected to both elemental and mineralogical analyses.

Moreover, the results suggest that REE-bearing heavy minerals are heavily concentrated in the beach face due to stronger oceanic currents generated by the strong winds of the southwestern monsoon along with the increased sediment supply by inland rivers.

For the liberation of Graphite from the related gangue materials, flotation circuits depend heavily on wet grinding of the ore with grinding mills. This produces significant amounts of Graphite fines, which are eventually lost to the tailings and discarded as wastes without further Graphite recovery. Agglomeration of the Graphite fines has been proven to be a size enlargement technique by previous studies. The character of Graphite agglomeration for beneficiation of low-grade Graphite tailing samples containing 23.4% to 25.5% Fixed Carbon (FC) obtained from Ragedara Graphite mine, Sri Lanka was assessed by varying the bridging liquid to tailing ratio and increasing the sample size. Comparative surface changes of upgraded Graphite were observed using Hitachi SU6600 Analytical VP FE-SEM. With respect to the froth flotation process, this novel method will need low water requirement while reducing the time for the separation of Graphite. The beneficiation study was able to obtain a concentrate with 88% fixed carbon at 69.6% recovery for 25 kg sample with no major surface structural changes compared with Natural Vein Graphite, indicating that it could be applied on commercial scale with periodic iterations for upgrading over 99% fixed carbon.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-3753-0","10.1109/MERCon52712.2021.9525795","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9525795","graphite beneficiation;waste minimization;sustainability;agglomeration","Water;Manufacturing processes;Veins;Ores;Lasers;Graphite;Production","","","","7","IEEE","14 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For a pair of languages for which monolingual data is available in such a pre-trained multilingual denoising model, the model can be fine-tuned with a smaller amount of parallel data from this language pair.

Most existing models do not consider the seemingly rare yet normal transactions into account when proposing collusive groups. Neither have they considered the effect of time within collusion. This work proposes a model to detect collusion in stock markets through the application of graph mining and anomaly detection. Creation of investor graphs denoting the relationships between investors and timely sampling of these graphs using Graph mining allows this research to consider the effect of time in collusion, subsequent anomaly detection allows for the filtering of results to avoid misnaming normal behaviour within the stock market.

The cell lengths were varied to identify the optimum cell lengths for the model. It was found that the vehicle flow in the selected section is significantly lower than the capacity of the expressway. Therefore, significant speed drops are not frequent. This model is more useful for expressways when it's at higher demand.

There are a number of methods developed to estimate highway capacity. Most of them focus on identifying the maximum flow or throughput using a traffic speed-flow model. However, it has been found that these capacity estimates are not practical as they cannot be sustained for long, under normal flow conditions. This research mainly focuses on using the breakdown probability approach, in capacity estimation methods which are currently used to estimate the capacity mainly for freeways. Breakdown probability methods such as the Product Limit Method (PLM), the Sustained Flow Index (SFI), the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) method are used to check the applicability of the breakdown probability approach in calculating highway capacity under heterogeneous conditions.

Using the available resources sparingly and optimally is the way forward to brace the scarcity of construction material, which we are about to face. There are many projects in progress to upgrade low-volume roads. But the designs are carried out using a 50mm asphalt wearing course, which is a conservative approach given the traffic movements of the roads are very much limited. For the traffic levels in such roads, using a thin asphalt layer between 25mm–35mm, the same design life could be achieved while cutting down construction costs for the pavement significantly.

A water resource action plan was developed to propose suitable stormwater quality and quantity controlling structures according to the unique hydrogeological behaviour of the Jaffna Peninsula. The proposed major artificial recharging units were introduced in the areas with adequate groundwater infiltration potential sites. Recharging reservoirs were assigned for the lagoon region with silt sedimentation. Dry wells were proposed for the region adjacent to the floodplain along with stormwater quality control structures. Paleochannel footprints were not found in the preliminary studies. Flood analysis using Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) Model indicated that the simulated inundation area of the 2017 flood event is reduced by 41.47% after the establishment of artificial recharging techniques.

In this paper, major and minor losses in pipe flow, calculated from empirical equations are compared with the experimental results using PVC pipes which is a popular commercial pipe category. For comparison on minor losses; Bend, Gradual contraction, Elbow bend, Gradual expansion, and 45 degrees bend which are widely used in distribution networks were used and coefficient of minor losses was used as a comparative factor. For comparison on major losses; PVC pipes with five different diameters were used and head loss vs Reynolds number variation was considered in the comparison.

The research work was focused on modeling a multi-junction device with a perovskite top cell and second generation bottom cell. These two cells were modeled and simulated under AM1.5G illumination and the final model of the tandem cell was optimized by considering the thicknesses of the absorber layers which is key to the performance. A surface defect layer (SDL) which previously proved buried homojunction was created at the CdS/CIGS interface. The existence of this layer increases the recombination at the homojunction. Therefore altering the properties of this layer was supposed to reduce the recombinations at the interface.

A Two-step spin coating method was used to prepare the thin films and dried them at different drying temperatures to transform MAI.PbI2.DMSO into pure CH3NH3PbI3. X-ray diffraction data indicate the improvement of the crystallinity as the drying temperature rises. Furthermore, the grain size increase with the drying temperature forming larger grains at 150°C.

In the travel domain, most questions are “content questions”, where the expected answer is not the equivalent of “yes” or “no”, but rather factual information. Replying to a free-form factual question based on a large collection of text is challenging. Previous research has shown that the accuracy of question answering systems can be improved by adding a classification phase based on the expected answer type. This paper focuses on implementing a multi-level, multi-class question classification system focusing on the travel domain. Existing research for the travel domain is conducted using language-specific features and traditional Machine Learning models. In contrast, this research employs transformer-based state-of-the-art deep contextualized word embedding models for question classification. The proposed method improves the coarse class Micro F1-Score by 5.43% compared to the baseline. Fine-grain Micro F1-Score has also improved by 3.8%.

In this paper, we propose a fusion method that can improve the real-time prediction accuracy of the EMG system by merging a probability matrix that represents the usage of the six grasping patterns for the targeted object. The YOLO object detection system retrieves a probability matrix of the identified object, and it is used to correct the error in the EMG classification system. The experiments revealed that the optimized ANN model outperformed the KNN, LDA, NB, and DT by achieving the highest mean True Positive Rate (mTPR) of 69.34%(21.54) in real-time for all the six grasping patterns. Furthermore, the proposed feature set (Age, Gender, and Handedness of the user) showed that their influence increases the mTPR of ANN by 16.05%(2.70).

Private vehicle share of 96% that mainly composed of two wheeled vehicles and three wheelers contribute to irregular traffic movements. The land available is inadequate for expansion in Jaffna Municipal Council region that prevents increasing road capacity. The study reveals that, at present, the bus operations are below the design capacity, which can cater additional passenger demand. However, poor transit accessibility, passenger comfort and lack of modernization in bus operations prevent passengers choosing it for commuting. Increasing private vehicle usage demands more parking space in the central business district. This study recommends to enhance bus operations so that the number of private vehicle commuters can be attracted to buses and thus traffic congestion and parking related issues due to private vehicles can be minimized.

First step is to determine passenger cumulative boarding and alighting by fare sections of a route based on bus ticket information or boarding and alighting counts. Then the cumulative boarding and alighting information is used for revenue estimation. To estimate the revenue, the bus fare for a given trip length is used for the first scenario and the moving average of sectional fare increments is used for others. A computer algorithm is developed to accommodate any scenarios. This algorithm helps to estimate the revenue of buses based on passenger boarding and alighting information and can estimate revenue for a given route or sections of a route, different passenger demand situations, different bus capacities and any service frequencies.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-3753-0","10.1109/MERCon52712.2021.9525713","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9525713","boarding;alighting;revenue;bus;methods","Estimation;Frequency estimation","","1","","9","IEEE","14 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Improper planning of infrastructure exacerbates negative impacts on urban microclimates that leads to an increase in average annual air temperatures by 1°C to 3°C, demonstrating an effect known as Urban Heat Island (UHI). Approximately one-third of the urban land uses are known to be covered with paved surfaces. Therefore, the contribution of pavements to UHI is of a serious concern. The energy performance of grey infrastructure is largely influenced by the materials associated, and the material's street physical properties. Identification of the thermal performance variations of pavers of alternative materials will assist landscape planners to select suitable paver types in an optimal way to reduce UHI, after considering the surrounding structures and the direction of shading. The current study was concentrated on three pavement types representing changes in materials; 1) Cement Pavers (CP), 2) Terracotta Pavers (TP) and 3) Grass Pavers (GP), to assess the thermal performance of pavement designs which are commonly used for urban pavement construction. The study was conducted in an urban environment in Colombo, Sri Lanka by considering three replicates for each material. One-way ANOVA was performed to analyze the significant differences on the thermal performance of different material types. According to the results obtained, both TP and GP showed significant difference to the thermal performance of CP from 9.00 AM to 3.00 PM. Furthermore, between 8.00 AM–3.00 PM there was no significance difference among the performance between GP and TP. However, TP showed the lowest surface temperature levels and heat emittance considering heat levels throughout the day. The maximum temperature difference compared to CP was shown at 1.00 PM as 4.49°C with TP and as 4.42°C with GP.

The formation of a thin chromium oxide layer on the alloy surface protects the alloy from further oxidation. The passivation layer formation is almost instantaneous when exposed to the ambient atmosphere. It prevents the strong bonding between the solder and the substrate due to the alteration of the substrate's surface energy by the passivation layer. Poor solderability could cause short-circuiting and resistance variations in electrical devices. This paper reviews the effect on solderability due to the passive layer formation and proposes solutions to overcome the problems caused by this layer. The introduction of solder-compatible metal layers such as Ni onto the substrate surface is a way to overcome this. However, solder-compatible metals such as Ni cannot be introduced with conventional electroplating baths due to the alloy's passive behavior. Therefore, a breakdown of the passivity is required before the nickel coating. A three-bath electrodeposition strategy comprising; pre-cleaning, activation, and electroplating, were used to achieve the task. The study examines the dependency of solder wettability on the current density, using an in-house fabricated contact-angle measuring device and analytical software.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-3753-0","10.1109/MERCon52712.2021.9525762","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9525762","contact angle;wettability;nickel coating;passivity breakdown;current density","Industries;Electrochemical deposition;Surface resistance;Metals;Nickel;Current density;Soldering","","","","34","IEEE","14 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The surfaces of these polymer substrates were subjected to different cold plasma treatments, using 80% N2 and 20% O2 as feed gas. The study covers the effect of the plasma dose and the plasma intensity on the printability and the degree of surface modification. The study determined the optimum plasma conditions for quality and durable prints.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-3753-0","10.1109/MERCon52712.2021.9525797","University of Moratuwa(grant numbers:SRC/LT/2018/18,SRC/LT/2018/05); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9525797","Plasma;Adhesion;PET;Printing;Ink","Plasma properties;Printing;Polyethylene;Correlation;Adhesives;Plastics;Feeds","","2","","34","IEEE","14 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, deep defects due to lattice disorders in the 3D halide perovskite cause to limit the performance of the halide perovskite solar cells. We have numerically simulated and investigated the optimum deep defect density of the 3D-MAPI layer of the p-i-n solar cell model with the structure of Glass/ITO(TCO)/PEDOT: PSS(HTM)/i-2D-MAPI/i-3D-MAPI/i-2D-MAPI/PCBM(ETM)/Ag. Due to the degradation of the organic components under some environmental conditions, the Pb-based organic perovskite solar cells need protective films. This 2D-3D-2D perovskite solar cell has been modeled as a stable perovskite solar cell, by inserting thin 2D-MAPI layers on both sides of the 3D-MAPI to reduce the degradation and moisture issues. Using SCAPS-1D solar cell simulation software, the deep defect density in the 3D halide perovskite layer was optimized to obtain the best performance of the cell model. Our simulation results have indicated that the deep defect density of the 3D-MAPI layer should not exceed 1012cm−3 for high performance. Also, low dark saturation current density and low Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination current density were observed at the low deep defect density in the 3D-MAPI layer.","2691-364X","978-1-6654-3753-0","10.1109/MERCon52712.2021.9525651","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9525651","perovskite solar cell;protective-layer;dark saturation current;deep defects;power-conversion efficiency","Degradation;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Photonic band gap;PIN photodiodes;Photovoltaic cells;Simulation","","","","27","IEEE","14 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Five varieties of graphite powder samples were chosen based on the specific industrial requirements and each were characterized through Thermal Constant Analyzer, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, and Ultrasonic pulse-echo method. The later method was adopted to obtain measurements of the Poisson's ratio ($\vartheta$), Young's modulus (E), and Shear modulus (G) of the graphite powder samples. Highest value of thermal conductivity, volumetric heat capacity, and thermal diffusivity was reported from the grade of graphite powder possessing larger particle size.

However, the few tools proposed by existing work to find anti-patterns that adopt graph concepts are not up to providing developers with adequate statistical information such as metrics along with visualization techniques or they are not fully automated.
