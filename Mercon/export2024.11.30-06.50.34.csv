The practice of employing Digital Image Correlation (DIC) based measuring techniques in experiments has increased due to its ability to generate full-field deformation information with minimal effort. Even though DIC systems are commercially available, the affordability of those systems is questionable in local context due to high capital costs. Most of the past studies related to DIC were focused on testing concrete, masonry and metallic alloy specimens, and little effort has been made on materials with recoverable large elongations. This paper presents a 3D full-field deformation measuring system that has been developed with a special focus on hyperelastic materials. The proposed system requires two common digital cameras for image acquisition, as the depth information is of interest. Images are then processed using the MATLAB-based algorithm developed to produce the full-field deformation map. Hyperelastic specimens of two different thicknesses were tested over 70% strain and the accuracy of the strain measurement using the proposed system is validated against physical measurements. The results have shown that the strains can be captured to an accuracy greater than 90% using the proposed technique.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185343","digital image correlation;image processing;full-field deformation map;3D reconstruction;hyperelastic material","Strain;Cameras;Feature extraction;Three-dimensional displays;Rubber;Optical imaging;Speckle","","3","","15","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the majority of applications can be seen in outdoor structures, the evaluation of long-term behaviour under various environmental conditions is an important aspect. In the present study, the bond performance of CFRP strengthened steel double strap joints immersed in distilled water at ambient (28 °C) and elevated (40 °C) temperatures for six months was examined. A total of twelve specimens were tested including four control specimens and eight number of conditioned specimens. A numerical model was also developed. The model results are in good agreement with experimental results. The bond shear stress - local slip curves were then developed for each environmental condition using model predicted strain readings. The bond-slip models showed a bond shear strength degradation of about 24 % at 28 °C and 30 % at 40 °C within the exposure duration of six months.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185311","CFRP/Steel joint;bond durability;moisture;hot environment;bond-slip relationship","Stress;Numerical models;Steel;Moisture;Finite element analysis;Predictive models;Temperature","","","","26","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The increasing trend in demand for construction material leads to an increase in the consumption of natural resources as well. So, to reduce the steel usage, bamboo can be used as hybrid reinforcement to achieve the benefits of both steel and bamboo, while compensating the disadvantages of each other. Bamboo is selected because of its high tensile strength to weight ratio, less carbon footprint, and rapidly growing ability. In this paper, details of the study carried out to analyze the behavior of three concrete slabs reinforced with steel and bamboo in comparison with the steel alone (control slab) is presented. All four slab specimens with dimensions of 1200 mm * 1200 mm* 60 mm were cast and tested under centerline loading. Flexural behavior of control slab reinforced with steel alone was compared with 3 hybrid-slabs reinforced with a different combination of steel and bamboo. The experimental results of 4 slabs were comparably similar, and these results were used to validate some numerical models too (developed in Midas software). It is concluded that steel and bamboo reinforced hybrid slabs can be used as an effective alternative.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185244","bamboo;hybrid reinforcement;concrete slab;sustainable material","Concrete;Steel;Slabs;Bonding;Moisture;Absorption","","1","","13","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Disaster resistant structures play a vital role in preventing loss of lives and damage to the belongings. A suitable material that could resist the forces of nature needs to be selected to ensure safety while reducing the adverse effects on the environment. Turning waste material into raw material is welcomed as the scarcity of natural resources and disposal of waste are becoming major issues nowadays. Such a method of replacing coarse aggregate with 100% recycled Expanded-polystyrene (EPS) is the production of lightweight concrete wall panels. A new trend of lightweight panels can be widely seen as partitions in reinforced concrete frame buildings. Incorporating these panels as a load-bearing element would lead to a drastic change in the industry. Hence a detailed study has been carried out to find out the properties of EPS panels with respect to embodied energy and carbon footprint. A comparative study has been conducted between two-storied refuge space with lightweight load-bearing panels and conventional materials such as cement blocks and fired clay bricks, through which the potential of lightweight wall panels as load-bearing walls for a two-storied refuge space is assessed.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185324","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185324","disaster resistant;lightweight wall panels;expanded polystyrene;embodied energy;carbon footprint","Carbon;Production;Buildings;Carbon dioxide;Resistance;Fly ash;Climate change","","5","","23","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These solar sails require larger area while in operation and are stored in the limited space available in launch vehicles by introducing series of fold-lines. Therefore, precise prediction of deployment behaviour is important in designing tear-free deployment configurations. Physical testing of such applications is difficult due to presence of gravity, air drag and friction which prevent such structures from deploying on Earth. Hence deployment of solar sails has to be tested under vacuum and zero gravity conditions. Virtual simulations are being used to overcome these challenges. This paper attempts to understand deployment behaviour of highly compacted thin membranes and highlight the importance of incorporating fold-line properties in finite element modelling. The effects of membrane thickness and creased geometry for the deployment behaviour and deployment force were also studied through force-displacement relationship of the membrane opening. It is shown that the connection with rotational stiffness gives better idealization for the fold-line in virtual environment. Further it is evident that the deployment force and shape have a significant influence from membrane thickness and fold-line geometry.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185241","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185241","Deployable structures;ultra-thin membranes;Miura-ori;crease intersection;fold-line stiffness","Force;Loading;Mathematical model;Geometry;Shape;Finite element analysis;Load modeling","","3","","10","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a parametric study on the homogenized response of two-ply plain woven carbon fibre composites. Influence of volume fractions, traction coefficients and fibre/resin material parameters on the laminate stiffness matrix (ABD) entries were investigated. For this study, a parametric representative unit cell is generated using a finite element pre-processor, TexGen and a Matlab based algorithm. An automated algorithmic computation of the laminate stiffness matrix is used to study its variations for different combinations of uncertain parameters. Such variations are compared with the experimental results to learn the possible reasons for the observed deviations between experimental and numerical results. It is shown that the volume fractions linearly scale the laminate stiffness entries, though interestingly, each entry has a unique scaling factor.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185307","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185307","woven fibre composites;parametric study;fibre volume fraction;surface traction coefficients;constituent material properties","Weaving;Laminates;Parametric study;Finite element analysis;Strain;Material properties","","3","","15","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So, it is required to identify the properties of concrete- filled steel tubes as a composite material. This paper focuses on a study conducted on concrete-filled circular steel tubes and galvanised square sections. Concrete filled circular steel tubes were tested under axial compression with three different diameter-to-thickness (D/t) ratios and two different concrete compressive strengths since CFSTs are most effective as compression members. Galvanised steel square sections were also tested for compression capacity and failure mode. Finite element model was developed using the ABAQUS software and two experimental programmes were carried out to find material properties of concrete and steel for finite element modelling and two experimental programmes were carried out to verify the finite element modelling. Galvanised iron square sections were modelled using MIDAS gen software and verified with experimental results for the failure load and failure mode also. The axial capacity of CFST was found theoretically using two different codes and one equation found in the literature. Experimental as well as numerical results showed that the axial capacity of CFST increases as the concrete infill increases and decreases with D/t ratios.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185319","concrete-filled steel tube;composite material;structural and economical effectiveness;axial compression;finite element modelling","Steel;Electron tubes;Concrete;Finite element analysis;Mathematical model;Iron;Civil engineering","","2","","7","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Initially, a pond system with cascade connectivity was identified in the Metro Colombo flood affected area and pond capacities, streamline network and catchment area of each pond were generated using Digital Elevation Model(DEM) and GIS software. Stream inflows were developed using 5-year storm event from IDF curves for Colombo and HEC-HMS software. Simulation of ponds during rainfall event was modelled using HEC-ResSim software and outflows were obtained for both isolated and cascade behavior of ponds. Flood maps of each pond for both cases were modelled using HEC-RAS software. Total flood inundation area of the 5-year storm event when the ponds are acting as isolated flood resisting structures and under holistic behavior is 74.7 ha and 63.9 ha respectively. Thus, the reduction of inundation area when the ponds are connected as a cascade is 10.8 ha which is 14.47% of the total inundation area.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185383","flash flood;cascade connectivity;HEC-ResSim;urban ponds","Floods;Software;Reservoirs;Mathematical model;Biological system modeling;Storms","","","","13","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Substantial economic benefits can be generated by implementing these innovative technologies. The construction industry is traditionally not being a desirable area for robotics application. However, with the discovery of more cost-effective applications and motives such as lack of labor population, the aging skilled workers, and safety issues, the use of robotics will undoubtedly increase. However, the fully-geared and advanced technological applications are still not implementing within the Sri Lankan construction industry, other than the basic applications that provide visible benefits. Therefore, there is a need to investigate the feasibility of introducing robotic technology to enhance the quality of the Sri Lankan construction industry. Hence, this paper aims to review the current application level of robotic technology and analyze its feasibility in the local construction industry. The research aim was achieved through a quantitative approach. A detailed questionnaire survey was carried out among subject-related professionals, and analysis was done with the descriptive statistical analysis technique.

Indian Ocean Tsunami which hit in 2004 is a crucial disaster incident where the lack of having effective communication modes for the warning dissemination emerged in many of the affected countries. To identify the community level perception on the existing communication modes in Sri Lanka, a field questionnaire survey was developed and conducted among 10 Grama Niladari divisions in the country and overall 323 community responses were obtained. As per the results obtained under the response analysis, traditional modes of communication were highlighted as the most effective communication mode both in urban and rural levels, among both males and females, and among each of the age category distribution. Further, the community perception level was indicated based on the mean perception score and sentimental perception score on the mobile-based communication platforms. This denoted that the community perception level is at a lower level over the warning dissemination through mobile-based platforms.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185325","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185325","Multi-Hazard Early Warning (MHEW);Communication modes;Community perception;Disasters","TV;Social network services;Tsunami;Mouth;Data collection;Hazards;Earthquakes","","5","","37","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We have drawn mappings between the WEF's robustness, resilience and resourcefulness and the structural engineering characteristics of robustness, redundancy and ductility. We use this first to propose a multi-sectoral framework involving the infrastructural, environmental, sociological, economic, and geopolitical sectors, also proposed by the WEF, but divide them into the three hierarchical levels of country, city and building. These three levels, three characteristics and five sectors give rise to a matrix of 45 aspects, with resilience features suggested for some of them. In this way we move towards proposing a multi-sectoral, multi-hierarchical resilience audit for a nation. We then use force-displacement analogies from structural mechanics to quantify resilience through an analogy to energy absorption, depending on the various levels of robustness, redundancy and ductility, thus generating an 8-point scale for a resilience index. The analogy suggests that ductility is the most important characteristic, but that it can be traded-off with redundancy. Redundancy is more important than robustness, but both are much more important for systems that lack ductility compared to those that possess it.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185398","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185398","resilience audit;resilience characteristics;multi-sectoral;structural mechanics analogy;energy absorption","Resilience;Redundancy;Robustness;Bars;Urban areas;Economics;Indexes","","","","12","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper discusses the development of a low cost WSN to monitor the acceleration response of civil engineering structures using off the shelf products. The developed system is capable of capturing synchronous acceleration response data with the sampling frequency of 100 Hz with a resolution of 0.5 mg. The collected data is processed and shared between peer nodes using sub 1 Gigahertz wireless protocol, and stored within an online based central data repository system replacing traditional data loggers. The developed low cost WSN is proved to be a better low cost alternative in the context of a target building with 48 floors (185 m height).","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185231","Wireless sensor networks;Low-cost data acquisition system;repository systems;Structural health monitoring;Time synchronization","Monitoring;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Accelerometers;Peer-to-peer computing;Buildings;Protocols","","2","","19","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A series of tests were done to identify the performance of commonly available grey fabric ('amu redi') with changing unsupported span lengths of fabric, thickness of overburden mud-concrete layers, and water content of the mud-concrete wet mix. The experimental work verified the viability of using commonly available fabric as formwork for typical mud concrete mixes. The study showed an upper bound on the thickness of the overburden mud concrete layer beyond which the influence on the fabric, measured as the maximum deflection, was negligible as arching effects transfers the loads laterally. A peak water content at which the maximum deflection of the fabric was the highest was observed.

In this study, fluidization behavior of both raw and dry black pepper at various bed weights was studied. Both raw and dry pepper found to exhibit aggregative fluidization and belong to group D of Geldart classification of solids. An empirical mathematical correlation was developed to relate Reynolds number at minimum fluidization velocity (Remf) and the bed weight per unit bed cross section for pepper. Additionally, Burke-Plummer equation of minimum fluidization was modified, and correlation coefficients were determined. Results thus obtained show that Umf is a function of bed weight per unit cross section to the power 0.25 and 0.35 for raw and dry black pepper, respectively.

This becomes an obvious problem when modelling large 2-D and 3-D plant tissues as there is a higher number of interactions between particles. Very few attempts have been recently reported to obtain efficient computational performance when modelling the drying phenomena of plant tissues. Therefore, this research aims to introduce a novel application of the Adaptive Fixed Neighborhood based SPH (AFN-SPH) method, where the fixed neighbourhood with a radius of three times the smoothing length, get updated timely to represent the dynamic changes of the problem domain. It was observed that AFN-SPH is beneficial particularly to simulate plant tissues in extreme drying. Both qualitative and quantitative good agreements were observed in results compared to the conventional SPH techniques. Further, around 30%-40% of time reduction was obtained for different tissues.

However, these alloys are known to have a protective oxide layer on their surfaces. The presence of this oxide layer leads to a significant reduction of wettability of common solder materials on the nichrome surfaces. Poor solderability will cause loose connections and electrical resistance fluctuations. This paper discusses an attempt made to address this issue through electroplating. Instead of the conventional industrial approach, this study has adopted a contact angle based method to monitor the solder wettability changes. A new piece of equipment, together with analytical software, was developed to do the task. Electrodeposition significantly improved solderability on the nichrome surface.

Manufacturing processes such as drawing, and rolling are depending on heat to reduce the forces associated with fabrication. The high-temperature requirement is potentially leading to stress, warpage, and reduced tolerance control. The manufacturing method called Electrically Assisted Manufacturing is introduced as an effective solution for these obstacles. The electroplastic deformation of low carbon steel under the simultaneous combination of uniaxial tensile conditions and electrical pulses was investigated. A reduction of the yield stress of low carbon steel having 0.2 wt% of carbon content was observed due to the electroplasticity. This work focused on developing a pulsed current generator to achieve the required combination of current density and pulse width for electroplasticity effect in these steel samples, and analysis of yield stress reduction qualitatively.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185238","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185238","Electroplasticity;Dislocations;Uniaxial Tensile Test;Electrically Assisted Manufacturing;Low Carbon Steel","Stress;Steel;Carbon;Strain;Current density;Capacitors","","2","","19","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although the country is moving towards industrialization, agricultural sector still contributes substantially to both foreign exchange earnings and GDP. Straw generated from paddy cultivation is widely considered as agricultural waste as it has less commercial value. However, cellulose is the main component in paddy straw, which is a renewable resource, gains increasing importance due to its low cost and wide availability. The aim of this study was to extract cellulose fibers from Sri Lankan traditional rice straw varieties Murunkan, Pachchaperumal and Moddaikarupan via a series of chemical treatments and to ascertain their structure, morphology and thermal properties. Study revealed that higher amount of cellulose fibers were extracted from Moddaikarupan variety (38.31 ± 0.86 percent), then from Murunkan variety (33.68 ± 0.68 percent) and lastly from Pachchaperumal variety (33.63 ± 0.10 percent). Fourier transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis showed the successive and complete removal of noncellulosic components from the rice straw.

Chemical extraction and purification method is found to be the most efficient method for cellulose extraction from lignocellulosic biomass. Therefore, it is of paramount important to investigate the influence of parent materials on the synthesis process and the properties of the yield. In this research, effect of particle size distribution of locally available rice straw on cellulose synthesis was studied.

In this work, we considered a robust OF model and we increased the robustness of this model to illumination changes and we studied effects in OF estimation of four different intermediate filters: Gaussian(GF), bilateral (BF), bilateral extended to the gradient domain (BFG), and median filter (MF). Our experiments were performed in a subset of the state of the art MPI-Sintel dataset. Using GF, we obtained an endpoint error EPE = 5.63; for BF we obtained EPE = 7.71; for BFG we obtained EPE = 7.67 and, for MF we obtained EPE = 4.77. The best performance was obtained for the MF but the GF performs also well. Considering processing time, the GF could be also suitable for optical OF.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185281","optical flow;median filter;bilateral filter","Estimation;Proposals;Optical filters;Computational modeling;Robustness;Lighting;Brightness","","","","18","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Denigration or insult is one form of cyberbullying. According to Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team, social media cyberbullying incidents are escalating. Insulting words are dynamic, and same word can have several meanings according to the context. Simply because a comment contains such a word, it cannot be classified as bullying. Hence, when labeling comments, simple keyword spotting techniques are inadequate. Other languages have addressed this issue using lexical databases such as WordNet which provides synonyms and homonyms of words. Since there is no proper lexical database developed for Sinhala language, detecting a word as bullying is a challenge. Therefore, we used rules to overcome this issue. Twitter comments with profane words were collected, outliers were removed, and remaining tweets were pre-processed. To determine insult in the text, five rules were used for feature extraction. Afterward, we applied Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Naïve Bayes algorithms. The results show that SVM with an RBF kernel performs better with an F1-score of 91%. Novelty of this research is the focus on Sinhala language cyberbully detection which has not been addressed before.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185209","cyberbullying;social media;text mining;sentiment analysis;machine learning","Feature extraction;Labeling;Twitter;Databases;Support vector machines;Facebook","","6","","28","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we propose a sentiment lexicon expansion method using Word2vec and fastText word embeddings along with rule-based Sentiment Analysis method. We expand the sentiment lexicon from the initial seed list of 2951 positive and 5598 negative words in two steps: (i) Gathering related words using Word2vec word embedding and (ii) Gathering lexically similar words using fastText word embedding. Our final lexicons UJ_Lex_Pos and UJ_Lex_Neg ended up with 10537 positive and 12664 negative words respectively which are labelled using Word2vec word embedding. Furthermore the rule-based Sentiment Analysis method uses expanded lexicons (UJ_Lex_Pos and UJ_Lex_Neg), lists of conjunctions and negational words to predict the sentiments expressed in Tamil texts.

Furthermore, the resulting data need to be accessed by many researchers and third-party applications. Existing weather data integration systems are based on monolithic or client-server architectures, and are proprietary or closed source. Hence, they are not only expensive to operate in an era of cloud computing, but also challenging to customize for regions with different weather patterns. In this paper, we present a Weather Data Integration and Assimilation System (WDIAS) that uses microservices architecture and container orchestration to achieve high scalability, availability, and low-cost operation. WDIAS provides a modular architecture to integrate data from different sources, enforce data quality controls, export data into different formats, and extend the functionality by adding new modules.

Multiple machine learning techniques have been adopted in binning metagenomic sequences. Specifically, unsupervised learning is being used in most of the recent binning methods. This work considers data-driven methods for binning metagenomic sequences and discusses such approaches in detail. Furthermore, it explores on increasing the amount of metagenomic sequences binned while maintaining a reasonable binning accuracy. Consequently, a dissimilarity-based approach is proposed to improve the number of contigs binned by an existing binning method. It is shown to result in a 10% increase in the number of contigs binned compared to the original approach. Accordingly, this work suggests that the effective use of observed data which may be discarded as outliers otherwise, may result in improved performance in binning.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185388","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185388","Metagenomics;binning;data driven;mahalanobis distance measure","Genomics;DNA;Sequential analysis;Bioinformatics;Taxonomy;Clustering algorithms;Benchmark testing","","","","22","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Capturing the global behavior of the structure (e.g. modal periods, mode shapes) using ambient response has become very common due to its applications in large number of damage detection methods. WSN is preferred over traditional tethered systems, mainly due to its dynamic nature and scalability. Capacity of handling large scale data and synchronized sensing are the two main aspects required for the efficiency of the WSN. The upper bound of the time synchronization error (jitter) in WSN should be kept in μs range in order to capture the modal behavior of the structures accurately. Currently, state of the art synchronization protocols that are used for this purpose, are not suitable for the low cost wireless sensor networks because those are radio driven, where the radio core and the CPU core are found separately. This paper discusses about the synchronized sensing method developed for low cost WSN. This protocol is proved to have less than 120 μs jitter and its implementation is discussed in the context of a target building with 48 floors (185 m high).","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185210","Synchronized sensing;Modal parameters;Wireless sensor networks;Jitter;Structural health monitoring;low cost","Synchronization;Clocks;Wireless sensor networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Monitoring;Protocols;Buildings","","","","20","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these systems are vulnerable to water scarcities during dry periods and excess inflows during floods as they are small in size. Most of the tanks are located in cascades, and a large number of their bunds breach during flood events due to their limited spillway discharge capacities. Hence, structural intervention to improve spillway discharge capacity is vital to make them robust for floods. This study assesses the ability to enhance the spillway discharge capacity of the lowermost tank in 216 village tank cascades in the Southeastern region of the country by adopting Piano Key Weir spillways. When the clear overflow spillways at the lowermost tanks in the cascades are replaced by Piano Key Weirs of higher discharge capacities, the number of cascades that can stand peak discharges of 50 year return period increased from 12% to 47% and from 60% to 84% for 0.3 m and 0.6 m affluxes respectively. Thus, the modernization of spillways by adopting Piano Key Weirs is a viable solution to improve the robustness of the village tank cascades for floods.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185363","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185363","flood analysis;ungauged catchments;peak discharge;natural spillways;piano key weir","Floods;Discharges (electric);Irrigation;Robustness;Fault location;Water resources","","1","","20","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A model was developed by using SUTRA (Saturated Unsaturated TRAnsient Model) with Model Muse as graphical user interface and calibrated until the percentage difference between simulated and observed freshwater lens volume is less than 10%. The impact of artificial recharge was identified by increasing the recharge rate by 5% and 10% of annual rainfall and simulating the previously calibrated model. The freshwater lens thickness and volume increase with artificial recharge. With 5% of annual rainfall as artificial recharge, the freshwater lens thickness of Dharavandhoo, Henbadhoo and Bodufulhadhoo island increased from 5.2 m to 6.9 m, 2.6 m to 4m and 1.5 m to 2.7 m, respectively.

The usual travel time collection process is thus replaced by using Google Maps API matrix. Shortest travel time and travel distance paths among main origin and destinations are analyzed and the contrast in shortest distance path not being the shortest travel time path brings an important consideration of the reasons associated mainly due to presence of bottlenecks which needs to be identified and rectified for better road user experience.

Malpractices committed by farmers as well as intermediaries throughout different stages of the vegetable supply have been the primary causes of post-harvest losses. This paper examines the role of intermediaries along the vegetable supply chain and identifies factors contributing to the post-harvest losses. The results are based on an in-depth personal interview with 7 industry personnel. The results revealed improper packaging, malpractices during transportation, careless handling, and unsuitable harvesting practices as major causes of post-harvest losses.

However, as there is some level of uncertainty due to the changes in traffic and roadside conditions, the estimations tend to deviate from the actual time of arrival. This study is focused on addressing the reliability of travel times and developing a methodology to compute and present the reliability as a quantity to the user to make decisions. As a demonstration study, alternative routes between a fixed origin-destination pair were selected. A dummy database of travel times was obtained through Google Maps for the analysis.

Here, the use of spin coating on textile surfaces was thoroughly investigated. This method is advantageous due to simplicity and relative ease of the process and ability to obtain thin and uniform coating. The experiments are carried using Titanium Dioxide as the coating material and the suitable fabric type is selected from Polyamide/Elastane and Cotton/ Polyester/ Elastane. The effect of an array of spin coating parameters such as rotational velocity, fiber type, concentration of solution and the binding agent was examined. Surface characterization, elemental analysis, air permeability and moisture management experiments were carried out to determine the coverage and effectiveness of the coating. It was found that the spin coating of Titanium Dioxide using Polyurethane as the binding agent onto Cotton/ Polyester/ Elastane blended, knitted fabric exhibits good adhesion and durability. Furthermore, it is recommended to use 3500 revolutions per minute with 0.5% concentration of TiO2 solution to achieve optimum coverage of the coating.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185265","spin coating;fabric coating;Titanium Dioxide;optimum coverage","Coatings;Fabrics;Surface treatment;Substrates;Solvents;Surface resistance","","6","","14","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When considering the applications of raw materials used in the construction industry, nearly 40% of them are used for manufacturing non-load bearing constructions such as partitioning materials. In this research, a method for manufacturing a novel biodegradable movable partitioning material has been discussed. This partitioning material is a composite, created with banana yarn as reinforcement, Poly-lactic acid as the matrix, manufactured using compression moulding technique. Furthermore, two different types of composites were manufactured by changing the yarn laying directions, which are unidirectional and bidirectional. Flexural and impact strength of both types of composites have been tested by varying the weight percentage, the pretension of yarns and processing parameters: moulding temperature and moulding pressure. Finally, several weight percentages, pre-tensioning values, moulding temperatures and moulding pressure values have been suggested in order to manufacture a quality partitioning material.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185232","composite;banana fibre;partitioning material;poly-lactic acid","Yarn;Programmable logic arrays;Cavity resonators;Clothing;Industries","","1","","7","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Alginate/Clay, Alginate/Sodium Silicate and Alginate/Graphene Oxide blended filaments were prepared by extruding their solution through a syringe having a diameter of 1/8"" to a coagulating bath of aqueous calcium chloride. The highest moisture regain for the filaments was obtained when the sodium alginate solution was mixed with graphene oxide. And also, the best values of the tensile strength and elongation at break were obtained when sodium alginate was blended with graphene oxide. The maximum tensile strength and elongation at break obtained by the addition of graphene oxide is 0.56N and 47% respectively. The addition of sodium silicate to alginate produced filaments with the lowest values for both the tensile strength and elongation at break.

Woven fabrics are capable of providing superior elastic properties, but how various fabric parameters affect elastic modulus is not well understood. In this study, two machine learning techniques were implemented to model the elastic modulus of woven fabrics and were compared with multivariable regressions. The two machine learning techniques used are Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest Regression. As input variables; weave factor (numerical representation of weave structure), warp yarn count and pick density were used. Both ANN and Random Forest Regression were able to generate reasonably accurate results with Random Forest Regression been the better of the two methods.

The proposed new model bridges the existing knowledge gap between the theoretical and empirical implications of energy conservation. Findings show that utilities have failed to match incentives, tariff regimes, regulations, and technology among different levels of consumer segments scientifically. Especially, the consumer groups belong to a monthly average consumption of 31- 90kWh, 91-120kWh, and 121-180 kWh are having a very high potential for energy conservation via various incentive schemes whereas consumers above 181kWh units have to be motivated towards energy conservation through various tariffs and regulatory influences. The consumers below 30kWh units bear no sense of responsibility and not even respond to generic energy conservation aspects or to regulatory regimes. Therefore, specific financial transfers and employment opportunities need to be introduced on this segment which is at the bottom of the pyramid.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185218","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185218","energy conservation;incentives;interventions;tariff regime;technology management","Energy conservation;Mathematical model;Incentive schemes;Numerical analysis;Software;Analytical models;Context modeling","","","","14","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Rear side forced water-cooling with a thermal collector which is known as the hybrid system was identified as the most feasible technique by considering economic and environmental factors. The theoretical model was developed to estimate the design parameters of the thermal collector and cooling performance. The number of ten thermal collector design configurations were modeled and analyzed the cooling performance using ANSYS fluent simulations. The best design configuration was identified based on heat transfer and manufacturing capability. A prototype of the selected design was manufactured to investigate the cooling performance experimentally. The experimental setup was developed using two 100 Watts solar panels and a small scale cooling tower. Both power and panel temperature variation were analyzed both numerically and experimentally. The numerical model was validated using experimental results and design parameters were optimized as it gives a better cooling performance. Both numerical and experimental analysis shows that integrating a rear side cooling system would increase both electrical and thermal efficiency by 65%. The electrical efficiency improvement is 2.5 % and electrical power generation is increased by 28% compared to the panel without cooling.

In this study, rubberwood chips were torrefied at a temperature of 300 oC for 60 minutes. The results show that the lower heating value of biomass increase from 14.58 MJ/kg to 16.38 MJ/kg after torrefaction. Further, a 300MWe coal-fired power plant was simulated using Aspen Plus software and co-firing possibilities of both raw and torrefied rubber wood were evaluated. The results reveal that up to 10% of thermal input can be substituted by raw rubberwood whereas torrefied rubberwood has the potential to substitute around 20% of thermal input without compromising the electrical efficiency. The total input mass flow rate is a crucial factor when co-firing is to be implemented in an existing plant even though it gives the expected energy output with a further increase of torrefied biomass share. With increasing co-firing ratio, it is observed that the total NOx and SOx emissions are reduced due to low N and S content of biomass.

A XRF characterization was conducted in the laboratory for the systematically collected field ore sample. It was confirmed that 0.6% Cu and 20-50% Fe are available in the sample on average. Raw ore samples followed a comminution process where the particle size was reduced up to 75μm. Sulfuric acid was used as the leaching medium. Particles below the size of 75μm gave optimum leaching efficiency. Leaching efficiency could be improved with increasing temperatures and acid concentrations. Optimum solid/liquid ratio was determined to be in the range 20/125 - 20/150 (g/ml) for leaching. Selective extraction of Cu cations from the leachate solution was successfully conducted using an Ammonia solution. Formed complex solution was filtered and treated with concentrated Sulfuric acid to prepare an electrolyte solution. Elemental analysis of the deposited layer from electrowinning the above solution gave 76.62% Cu along with current efficiency of 72% and power consumption of 1023.5 kWh/t. It was concluded that this methodology is economically feasible when compared with electrowinning the leachate directly, which resulted only 62.88% Cu with comparatively lower current efficiency of 50.95% and higher power consumption of 3097 kWh/t.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185341","acid leaching;absorption spectrometry;selective electrowinning;copper extraction","Leaching;Copper;Electrolytes;Ores;Feeds;Iron;Electrodes","","","","5","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Inverters are commonly used to integrate renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar to the power system. Conventional power generation such as Coal, Nuclear, Hydro are based on synchronous generators. Due to the large integration of renewable power plants, the power system is moving towards an inverter dominant power system. This can make a significant impact on the system inertia response. Inertia is given from the rotating mass of the conventional generators but, inverters cannot contribute to system inertia as there are no rotating masses. Lack of inertia will weaken the stability of the system under disturbances. As a result, system frequency will fluctuate beyond its limits. This limits the integration of renewable sources to grids. However, inverters can emulate inertia response because of the fast response and the high controllability. This paper presents two novel controllers that can be used to emulate the inertia response. One controller is for the virtual inertia controlling and the other controller is for energy management. Results are obtained and analyzed in a simulated PV-Hydro microgrid under supply-demand mismatch.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185333","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185333","Energy Management;Renewable integration;Transient frequency stability;Virtual Inertia","Inverters;Mathematical model;Topology;Frequency measurement;Power generation;Synchronous generators;Frequency control","","3","","21","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, distributed solar PV will become a ubiquitous component of modern power distribution systems. This paper investigates the impact of solar PV systems on the adequacy of power distribution systems. Firstly, the system Energy Not Supplied (ENS) is calculated for the RBTS bus 2 system when there is a line outage. The AC optimal power flow analysis is used to evaluate the distribution system states. Different levels of solar PV integration and various solar PV placements are considered to analyse the impact of solar integration on the reliability of power distribution networks. Then, Monte Carlo simulation is used to obtain the ENS of the system by simulating the distribution system operation. The forced outage rates of the system components are considered in the study to model the stochastic operation of the system. The results show that solar PV can significantly reduce the ENS of the system when there is an outage in the system. When 0.75, 1.5, 2.25 MW and 4.5 MW solar capacities are integrated, the daytime ENS is reduced by 5.9 %, 11.6 %, 17.1 % and 32.6 % respectively.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185310","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185310","distribution system adequacy;Monte Carlo simulation;optimal power flow;solar PV","Reliability;Load modeling;Mathematical model;Power system reliability;Load flow analysis;Solar power generation","","2","","8","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it may lead to the generation of some natural frequencies due to the combination of inductor and capacitor. These frequencies are called as sub-synchronous frequencies which are below the power frequency of the power systems. They can give rise to sub-synchronous resonance (SSR). The SSR can cause physical damages to the power system equipment unless it is detected and mitigated prudently. This paper presents a robust controller which can be used to damp undesirable sub-synchronous oscillations. The small signal model required to design the controller is constructed using dynamic phasor approach. The performance of the controller is demonstrated using IEEE first benchmark model (FBM) for SSR studies.

Furthermore, the robot is comprised of flexible upper body linkage mechanism capable of adapting to the lumbar curvature and assuming the shape of the trunk. A mathematical model is formulated to estimate the hip torque profile for the stoop lifting cycle. Moreover, a torque control approach was introduced to control the robot according to the motion intentions of the user. The experimental results reveal that HipExo is effective in reducing muscle activity during stoop lifting and it has the potential of alleviating lift-related musculoskeletal disorders.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185345","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185345","exoskeleton;trunk linkage mechanism;hybrid actuator;load lifting;hip joint","Hip;Actuators;Torque;Exoskeletons;Couplings;Springs;Robots","","3","","23","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Especially when constructing bridges, huge experience, and extensive knowledge is important. Knowledge Management (KM) is the key to share explicit and tacit knowledge in the bridge construction. As an initiation for the KM, an ontology for bridge maintenance was developed. As the first step bridge maintenance related data were collected. Then taxonomy was developed. As a next step, the bridge maintenance ontology was developed using Protégé OWL Ontology Editor. Finally, the modeled ontology was evaluated using tools and ontology experts. We strongly believe that our novel approach to bridge maintenance ontology can support all the actors on the construction site and as well as students and researchers.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185335","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185335","bridge management;knowledge management;ontology;construction","Bridges;Ontologies;Maintenance engineering;Taxonomy;Data collection;OWL;Knowledge management","","1","","32","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Blockchain-based product traceability solutions attempt to integrate the data silos of suppliers into an immutable and distributed ledger to provide consumers with a transparent and trustworthy system to trace back a product at hand. A common limitation of these solutions is the use of blockchain to provide only the proof of existence of data. We propose a solution where data related to enforcement of product-quality specifications and production limits, merging and splitting products as batches, and mixing of ingredients are handled within the block-chain itself to provide greater consistency, transparency, and trust. Our solution is based on a graph data structure built into the blockchain nodes, smart contracts, and facilitation of different roles in a supply chain. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed solution by implementing it on the Hyperledger Fabric platform. Performance results confirmed that both the graph data structure and blockchain has acceptable throughput and latency characteristics.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185207","blockchain;data silos;supply chain;smart contract;traceability","Dairy products;Production facilities;Merging;Contracts;Hafnium","","4","","12","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the main reasons for such negligence is the cost overhead of unit testing. Often, project managers and tech-leads, either ignore unit testing or carry out it in a shallow level taking the trade-off between carrying out unit testing and the cost it would incur. This research suggests a model-based unit testing specification and code generator based on model specifications. While formalisms such as the huge amount of unit test inputs, complex specifications and complex technologies exist can be used, one must consider the practical usability of the proposed solution in the industry. Generic spreadsheet-based tool is used to create the unit test specification; C++ unit test code generate for Google Test. It provides comprehensive unit test specifications, complete unit test codes and informative unit test reports. The tool is applied to five different industrial software projects with each having six target functions, (sum n=36 target functions). Results have been further validated by experienced expert architects. The evaluation confirmed that the proposed solution provides an efficient and rapid way to write error-free unit test cases and generate unit test code.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185378","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185378","Google mock;Google test;unit test;unit test code;unit test specification","Testing;Software;Tools;Google;Java;C++ languages","","","","15","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It allows developing business applications in a decentralized manner by dividing the important business logic into separate independent services. Digital certificates are used to verify the identity of microservices in most cases. However, the certificate authorities (CA) who issue the certificates to microservices cannot be trusted always since they can issue certificates without the consent of the relevant microservice. Nevertheless, existing implementations of certificate transparency are mostly centralized and has the vulnerability of the single point of failure. The distributed ledger technologies such as blockchain can be used to achieve decentralized nature in certificate transparency implementations. A blockchain-based decentralized certificate transparency system specified for microservices architecture is proposed in this paper to ensure secure communication among services. After the implementation and deployment in a cloud service, the system expressed average certificate querying time of 643 milliseconds along with the highly secured service provided.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185320","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185320","microservices;security;decentralized certificate transparency;blockchain;certificate authority","Servers;Monitoring;Cryptography;Computer science;Computer architecture","","1","","19","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The novelty of this study lies in the methodology followed for the object detection process using RetinaNet one stage detector and region-based convolutional neural network deep learning technique. The proposed software architecture consists of low coupled components that support scalability and reliability. The developed web-based and mobile-based client applications assist to find parking spaces easily and efficiently.

To address this issue, we propose a hybrid approach for Accurate and Interpretable Representation Learning (AIRL) method for embedding entities and relations of knowledge graphs by utilizing the rich information located in entity descriptions and hierarchical types of entities. Here we use hybrid approach to learn interpretable knowledge representations by capturing the semantics and structure of entities using this rich information. We adopt FB15K dataset generated from a large knowledge graph freebase, to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The results of experiments demonstrate AIRL significantly outperforms translation embeddings and other state-of-the-art methods.","","978-1-7281-9975-7","10.1109/MERCon50084.2020.9185274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185274","interpretability;entity description;entity hierarchical type;knowledge graph;representation learning","Semantics;Atmospheric modeling;Knowledge engineering;Computer science;Encoding;Natural language processing;Task analysis","","1","","35","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
